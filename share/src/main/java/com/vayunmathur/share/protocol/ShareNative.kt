/**
 * JNI surface for the native Quick Share protocol crate (libshare_nearby.so) —
 * session half: create/feed/drain/query/destroy plus file staging.
 *
 * Discovery and endpoint-info codecs live in [ShareNativeDiscovery]. The split is
 * purely organizational: every `nativeX` here still binds to
 * `Java_com_vayunmathur_share_protocol_ShareNative_nativeX` in
 * `share/src/main/rust/src/lib.rs`, so the Rust side is untouched.
 *
 * Kotlin owns transport (NSD/BLE discovery + TCP sockets and file I/O); Rust owns the
 * pure state machine: the Nearby Connections connection handshake, UKEY2 with the
 * `AES_256_CBC-HMAC_SHA256` record protocol, the paired-key exchange, `OfflineFrame`
 * and Sharing `Frame` encode/decode, and payload chunking. No networking touches Rust.
 *
 * Threading: all calls are synchronous and must be serialized per session handle.
 * Call from a single coroutine / background thread per session.
 *
 * Lifecycle (see share/PROTOCOL_CONTRACT.md for the full spec):
 * ```
 * handle = nativeInit(localName, localEndpointInfo, localEndpointId, isInitiator)
 * repeat { if ((bytes = socket.read()) != null) nativeFeedInbound(handle, bytes) }
 * while ((rec = nativeDrainReceived(handle)) != null) appendToFile(rec)
 * while ((out = nativeDrainOutbound(handle)) != null) socket.write(out)
 * state = nativeQueryState(handle); files = nativeQueryPendingFiles(handle)
 * nativeAccept(handle, accept, destDir)     // after the user taps Accept/Reject
 * nativeDestroy(handle)                     // always, e.g. in finally / onCleared
 * ```
