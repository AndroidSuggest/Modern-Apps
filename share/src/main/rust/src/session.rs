//! Session state machine: Nearby Connections handshake, UKEY2, paired key, transfer.
//!
//! # Phases
//!
//! Everything is carried over the 4-byte-big-endian-framed socket described in
//! [`crate::frame`]. The channel changes meaning three times:
//!
//! | Phase | Body of each framed message | Source |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | [`Phase::Connecting`] | plaintext `OfflineFrame` — `CONNECTION_REQUEST` | `p000\dnlx.java:669-675` validates it |
//! | [`Phase::Ukey2`] | plaintext `Ukey2Message` — ClientInit / ServerInit / ClientFinished | `p000\dnij.java:102-107` writes all three through the same channel |
//! | [`Phase::ConnectionAccept`] | plaintext `OfflineFrame` — `CONNECTION_RESPONSE` | `p000\dncj.java:1204` writes it before the encryptor exists at `:1208` |
//! | [`Phase::PairedKey`], [`Phase::Ready`] | D2D-encrypted `OfflineFrame` | `p000\dnhn.java:212` encrypts before the length prefix, `:372` decrypts after it |
//!
//! # Ordering
//!
//! The response comes **after** UKEY2, not before, and both sides send it in
//! plaintext. Verified at four independent sites:
//!
//! - the client writes `CONNECTION_REQUEST` and then *immediately* starts the UKEY2
//!   client without waiting for anything (`p000\dnsi.java:9582` then `:9633`);
//! - the server reads `CONNECTION_REQUEST` and starts the UKEY2 server, sending no
//!   response (`p000\dnsi.java:5106` then `:5129`);
//! - `acceptConnection` writes `CONNECTION_RESPONSE` at `p000\dncj.java:1204` and
//!   only *then* calls `doeq.mo63639c()` at `:1208`, so it cannot have been
//!   encrypted;
//! - the encryptor is installed by `evaluateConnectionResult`
//!   (`p000\dnsi.java:4319`), which returns early unless **both** sides have
//!   accepted (`:4327-4339`).
//!
//! Accepting is programmatic at this layer, not a user prompt — Quick Share calls
//! `acceptConnection` as soon as the connection is offered (`p000\dzuj.java:76`) and
//! prompts the user later, with the Sharing-layer `INTRODUCTION` / `RESPONSE`.
//!
//! Sharing frames (`INTRODUCTION`, `RESPONSE`, `PAIRED_KEY_*`) are never framed
//! directly: each one is the body of a **BYTES** payload inside a
//! `PAYLOAD_TRANSFER` `OfflineFrame`. File bytes are **FILE** payloads.
//!
//! # UKEY2 cipher
//!
//! The record protocol is `AES_256_CBC-HMAC_SHA256` and nothing else. GMS offers
//! exactly that string (`p000\jgzt.java:798`) and rejects any other with
//! `"Incorrect next protocol"` / alert 103 (`p000\jgzt.java:550-551`). Offering
//! `Aes256GcmSiv`, as this module previously did, is rejected outright.
