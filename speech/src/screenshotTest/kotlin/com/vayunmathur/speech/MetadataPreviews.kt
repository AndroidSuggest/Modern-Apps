/**
 * Store listing images for `:speech`, rendered from Compose previews instead of from an
 * instrumented test on a device. See `common-conventions-preview-metadata`.
 *
 * `./gradlew :speech:metadata` renders these and copies the PNGs into
 * `metadata_data/photos/speech/`, where `release.sh` picks them up.
 *
 * Three things to keep in mind when editing:
 *
 *  - Order comes from the function names. The generated PNG filenames embed them, so
 *    `Preview1Setup`/`Preview2Ready`/... sort into listing order.
 *  - Each preview needs @PreviewTest as well as @Preview. @Preview alone renders in Studio
 *    but is not collected as a screenshot test, which surfaces as "did not discover any
 *    tests". Previews must also be class members, not top-level functions, for the same
 *    reason: the engine discovers them as JUnit tests.
 *  - Everything is a literal. The real screen reads Settings.Secure, a runtime permission
 *    and two ~100 MB model directories to decide which steps are done — none of which
 *    exists in a preview, which is exactly why that state was hoisted out of the screen.
 *
 * The setup checklist is the whole app: once the models are installed and the services are
 * selected, this app has no UI of its own and works through every *other* app's voice input
 * and read-aloud. So the listing shows the checklist before and after.
