/**
 * Pooled HTTP engine behind [NetworkClient.execute] (issue 815).
 *
 * MapLibre parity for the range-fetch path: [HttpUrlEngine] opens a fresh `HttpURLConnection`
 * per request with no pool or HTTP/2 config, so a cold screenful of tiles pays a TLS handshake
 * per range. This keeps one shared `OkHttpClient` — connection pool, HTTP/2 multiplexing, and
 * `Dispatcher.maxRequestsPerHost = 20` matching MapLibre's `HttpRequestImpl` — so the second
 * range reuses the first's connection.
 *
 * Scope is deliberately narrow: only `execute` (the JNI bridge's range fetches, image
 * fetching, traffic/street-view reads) moves here. `performRequest`, `stream`,
 * `performRequestInputStream` and the JSON path stay on [HttpUrlEngine], whose redirect,
 * decompression and streaming semantics they depend on. Redirects *are* followed here
 * (OkHttp default), and the final URL is reported like `execute` always did.
 *
 * TLS never leaves `:library:network`: the client is built once per trust state from the same
 * [BundledTrust] pair `init` installed, and rebuilt when `init` changes the bundle. A per-call
 * [SSLSocketFactory] without its manager cannot back a pooled client, so explicit factories
 * fall back to [HttpUrlEngine] rather than partitioning the pool per connection.
 *
 * Synchronous `suspend` shape, like the engine it replaces: the JNI bridge calls through
 * `runBlocking`, so this must not change threading — OkHttp's own dispatcher threads do the
 * I/O inside the blocking `execute()` call, which runs on `Dispatchers.IO`.
