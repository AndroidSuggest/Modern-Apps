/// Every run's points share one bounding square, so the whole route is one vertex/index
/// pair — the casing is then a single draw over the lot and each run's fill is a draw of
/// its own index slice (see [`RouteMesh::segments`]). A single-colour route (the car) is
/// just a one-run list and takes the same path.
///
/// `None` covers an empty list and a list every run of which is degenerate — empty, a
/// single point, or all-coincident points, none of which has a direction to stroke. A run
/// that is degenerate on its own is skipped rather than failing the whole route, so one
/// glitchy zero-length step does not blank a route being followed. A caller clearing the
/// route passes an empty slice and gets `None`, which is the same thing.
