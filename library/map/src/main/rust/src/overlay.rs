//! Geographic overlay polylines: the navigation route drawn inside the renderer.
//!
//! On the phone the route is a Compose overlay *above* the map surface. Android Auto
//! hands the app a bare `Surface` with no view hierarchy, so there is nothing to put an
//! overlay in and the line has to be drawn by the renderer itself.
//!
//! # A list of coloured segments, one casing
//!
//! The phone colours the route per navigation step — traffic red/amber/green, transit
//! brand colours, a travelled grey behind the puck — and that colouring now lives here
//! rather than in a Compose overlay, so the route pans in lock-step with the basemap the
//! way the puck, region mask and traffic already do. A route is therefore a *list* of
//! coloured runs: [`tessellate`] takes a slice of [`RouteSegment`], each its own polyline
//! and fill colour, and strokes them into one shared mesh.
//!
//! The casing is drawn once over the whole mesh at the wider width and one colour, then
//! each segment's fill is drawn over it in segment colour — so the outline stays
//! continuous across the colour changes while every run keeps its own fill. The car
//! (Android Auto) passes a single segment through the same path, which is the old
//! single-colour route with no special case.
//!
//! # It reuses the road tessellator, and it has to
//!
//! [`crate::tess::stroke`] already strokes every road in the basemap: miter joins, butt
//! caps, a unit join normal per vertex and the width supplied as a push constant. A route
//! is a line with a width, so it goes through the same function and comes out in the same
//! vertex format, drawn by the same `line` pipeline and the same shaders. Writing a second
//! tessellator would be a second set of join bugs to find.
//!
//! # Why there is no re-tessellation on zoom
//!
//! `stroke` wants tile-local coordinates in `0..extent` and produces positions in `0..1`.
//! A route is not tile-bound, so it gets a square of its own: its bounding box, squared
//! off, with the geometry normalised into it. That square is then placed by
//! [`crate::camera::Camera::world_quad_to_clip`] exactly the way a tile is placed by
//! [`crate::camera::Camera::tile_to_clip`].
//!
//! The pay-off is that **the mesh is zoom-independent**. Web Mercator is a pure scale in
//! zoom — `project(lon, lat, z)` is `project(lon, lat, 0) * 2^z` — so normalising by the
//! bounding box divides that factor out and the local coordinates are the same number at
//! every zoom. Only the matrix and the pixel width change per frame, and both are already
//! per-frame values. So a route is tessellated **once, when it is set**, and a car that
//! sits in a navigation session for an hour re-tessellates nothing: no per-frame work, no
//! per-zoom-step work, no threshold to tune. That was the thing worth getting right here,
//! because the phone can afford to redo geometry on a zoom step and a car on battery
//! cannot.
//!
//! The cost is precision. Positions are `f32` in `0..1` against a span that is the whole
//! route's bounding box, so a continent-crossing route resolves to about a hundredth of a
//! Dp on screen — invisible — while a city-scale one is exact to well under a pixel.
