/// painted markings, the `junction-connector` surface that continues it through an intersection,
/// the carriageway taper, and the road-surface turn arrows. Off for release; the code stays.
///
/// **This is the map surface, not the navigation lane guidance bar.** The two share the word
/// "lane" and nothing else: the guidance bar is a Compose overlay fed by the router's per-step
/// lane data, it has no connection to a style layer, and it draws whatever this says. Do not
/// read a blank map surface as the guidance bar being off, or vice versa.
/// It works by dropping the two [`Layer::carriageway`] layers from [`layers`], which is the one
/// point every part of the feature already funnels through. No carriageway layer means
/// `tile::geometry`'s carriageway branch is never taken (so no ribbon mesh, no taper), and
/// [`road_carriageway_layer`] answers `None`, which is what
/// [`crate::vulkan::renderer::Renderer::record_arrows`] gates the turn arrows on. Dropping the
/// layers rather than clearing the flag matters: a `carriageway` layer with the flag off would
/// fall through to the ordinary stroke path and draw a 40px grey band over every road at z20.
///
/// The plain road line layers (`roads-major` and friends) are untouched and already draw
/// *underneath* the carriageway pass, so removing that pass uncovers them rather than leaving a
/// hole — the map returns to its pre-carriageway appearance.
///
/// Not a [`super::Toggle`]: those are a host-app opt-in the user sees. This is a release kill switch,
/// so it is a `const` and flipping it is a code change.
///
/// # Before turning this back on
///
/// Check that the frame loop can still idle. Turning this on re-enables
/// [`crate::vulkan::renderer::Renderer::record_arrows`], which uploads a transient buffer per
/// arrow batch per frame; if the on-demand loop still treats a non-empty transient list as
/// "needs another frame", arrows re-arm it every frame and the map redraws forever with nothing
/// moving. The switch being off is the only reason that is unreachable today, so it will surface
/// as a battery regression the day the feature returns rather than as a failing test.
