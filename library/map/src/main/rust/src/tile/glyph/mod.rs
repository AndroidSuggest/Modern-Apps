//! The SDF glyph atlas: Noto Sans rasterised once, sampled every frame.
//!
//! MapLibre renders text from a signed-distance-field atlas: each glyph is a small
//! bitmap whose texels store _distance to the glyph edge_, so the fragment shader
//! gets crisp edges at any size with `smoothstep`, plus a halo for free. This is
//! that atlas, built at first use from the bundled TTFs (task 54 staged
//! `library/map/src/main/rust/assets/fonts/NotoSans-Regular.ttf` and `-Medium.ttf`).
//!
//! # Why runtime, not build-time
//!
//! The TTFs are compiled in with `include_bytes!` rather than read through the
//! `AssetManager`, because an APK asset is not a file this renderer can open
//! without a JNI fd handoff. They therefore live under the **crate's** own
//! `assets/` (`library/map/src/main/rust/assets/fonts/`) and not under
//! `src/main/assets/`: anything in the latter is packaged into every consumer's
//! APK, which shipped these 1.5 MB a second time for bytes no code path reads.
//!
//! Rasterising at first use costs milliseconds once:
//! ~95 Latin codepoints × 2 weights, each a 4x `ab_glyph` rasterise followed by an
//! 8SSEDT distance transform over a ≤128px cell. The atlas is a single R8 image
//! (16×16 cells of 64px = 1024px) uploaded to Vulkan once.
//!
//! # Metrics live here, shaping in `tess::text`
//!
//! `ab_glyph`'s unscaled metrics are in font units (1/upem em); the atlas stores
//! them per (weight, char) so shaping needs no font handle. Kerning is
//! `kern_unscaled` between consecutive ids. UV rects address the R8 image.
