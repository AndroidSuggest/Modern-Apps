/// ANCESTOR_DEPTH` while this mesh is resident. Gating on `z` alone — the tile's own zoom —
/// bakes a decision that only holds at the moment of tessellation: an ancestor then carries
/// no `landuse` or `buildings` at all, because those layers' `min_zoom` is above its own,
/// and whole families of geometry appear only once the exact-zoom tiles land rather than
/// the ancestor standing in for them.
///
/// So the gate here is the *widest* it could need to be, and the renderer decides what is
/// actually visible against the camera's own zoom every frame. Layers outside the window
/// are still skipped, which keeps this bounded: a z5 tile does not tessellate buildings.
///
/// Symbol layers shape here zoom-independently (string → advances); per-frame sizing
/// happens in the renderer from `labels`, which carries the shaped candidates while
/// `meshes` carries no symbol vertices (they would be stale the next frame).
