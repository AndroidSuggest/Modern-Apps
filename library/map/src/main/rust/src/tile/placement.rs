//! Screen-space label placement: greedy, rank-ordered, per-frame.
//!
//! M1 places _point_ labels only (country/region/locality/subplace). Each tile
//! shapes its candidates once ([`crate::tile::symbol`]); this module decides, per
//! frame, which candidates draw: sort by rank (country first), greedily accept
//! while the screen box collides with nothing accepted yet.
//!
//! # Coordinates
//!
//! Collision runs in _screen px_: the caller passes each candidate's screen box
//! (computed from the anchor's clip position + the frame's text size). This keeps
//! the module free of camera math and testable with literal boxes.
//!
//! Projection is pitch-aware ([`project_to_screen`]): at pitch 0 it is the linear
//! map, and under tilt it carries the perspective divide the billboard shader
//! applies — so a box sits where its label draws, and distant POIs compress onto
//! overlapping boxes the rank-ordered placer thins by importance.
//!
//! # Rank
//!
//! Lower is more important: country (0) > region (1) > locality (2) > subplace
//! (3) > POI (4), 255 for an id the renderer did not recognise (sinks last). Ties break
//! by population weight (higher first — a big city beats a town), then by
//! larger box (more informative), then by id order — deterministic, so frames
//! don't shimmer.
//!
//! # Variable anchors
//!
//! A POI label may be drawn to the left or the right of its icon
//! (`text-variable-anchor: ["left", "right"]`), so a candidate carries two boxes and
//! [`place`] reports which one it accepted. The renderer then emits at that anchor, which
//! is what makes a label near the edge of a crowd flip to its other side instead of
//! disappearing.
