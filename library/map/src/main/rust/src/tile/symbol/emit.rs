/// Emit one shaped label's quads at the size and anchor the caller resolved for it.
///
/// `text_px` is DEVICE px (the layer's size arm at the camera zoom x camera density -
/// the ramp is authored in Dp, the shader and the tile span are device px). The wrapper
/// exists so the unit contract lives in one place instead of at every call.
///
/// `anchor` and `offset_em` are the resolved variable anchor and the layer's
/// `text-offset`: [`Anchor::Center`] with a zero offset is the place-label path and is
/// exactly what this drew before POI existed.
///
/// Rank emphasis used to live here as a fixed multiplier (1.25x for big cities, 0.85x
/// for hamlets) standing in for the authored data-driven size arms. The style carries
/// those arms properly now - see `Layer::text_size_for` - so the caller resolves the
/// size and this just draws it.
///
/// `rotation` is the camera's `(cos, sin)` (see [`crate::camera::Camera::rotation`]): the
/// emitted quads are counter-rotated about the anchor so the label stays **upright**
/// under a heading-up camera. `(1.0, 0.0)` is north-up and costs nothing.
///
/// A **curved** label — one carrying a [`centreline`](ShapedLabel::centreline) — takes a
/// different path: its single line is laid along the polyline by
/// [`text::emit_curved`](crate::tess::text::emit_curved), one glyph per vertex rotated to the
/// local tangent, and it is **not** counter-rotated. A curved label is map-aligned, so its
/// orientation is the road's, not the camera's; `anchor`, `offset_em` and `rotation` are unused
/// on that path.

/// label beside it, which follows a `text-size` ramp. The label's `text-offset` is what
/// keeps the two from overlapping.
///
/// Goes into a **separate** buffer from the text: the two sample different atlases through
/// different fragment shaders (a picture against a distance field), so they cannot share a
/// draw even though they share a pipeline layout and a vertex format.
///
/// `rotation` counter-rotates the quad exactly as it does for the text beside it, so a POI
/// pictogram stays the right way up under a heading-up camera. Tilt is handled separately and
/// on the GPU: every corner carries the label's ground anchor, and the billboard vertex shader
/// projects that anchor and hangs the corner off it at a constant screen offset, so the icon
/// faces the camera at any pitch. The half-extents below stay a tile-local offset *from* the
/// anchor rather than a resolved screen position, which is what lets the shader do that.
