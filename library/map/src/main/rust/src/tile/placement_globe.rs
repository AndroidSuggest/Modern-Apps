/// Globe-aware screen projection for label placement: lon/lat through the

///
/// Split from `placement.rs` (file-length limit). The flat `project_to_screen`
/// feeds a tile-local point through the tile's clip matrix; on the globe the
/// matrix bends (a 4x4 cannot bend a sphere), so labels placed through it land
/// in flat positions while the basemap under them draws bent — the scattered
/// text of the broken globe. These helpers project through the same
/// `globe_point` basis the vertex shaders and the CPU anchor use, with the
/// same screen convention (`halfH - y`, north up) and the same far-side cull
/// far-side cull (z < 0 draws nothing).
//

// `BoxInputs` and `Obb` (and the whole parent scope) are already in scope.
