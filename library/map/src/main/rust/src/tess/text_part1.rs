/// Emit two triangles per glyph of a single shaped line laid along a tile-local `centreline`.
///
/// The baseline follows the polyline and every glyph is rotated to its local tangent, so a
/// street or river name curves with its line. This is the counterpart of [`emit`] for a
/// **line** label, and it differs in two deliberate ways:
///
/// * There is no anchor, offset or justification — the run is centred on the polyline's length
///   by [`layout_along_line`].
/// * The caller must **not** pass the result through [`upright`]. A curved label is map-aligned
///   (MapLibre's `text-rotation-alignment: map`): its orientation is the geometry's tangent, not
///   the camera's bearing, so counter-rotating it would fight the curve it is meant to follow.
///
/// Vertical placement mirrors [`emit`]: the baseline sits half a cap-height below the centreline
/// (screen-down), so the cap box straddles the line. Each quad still covers the glyph ink plus
/// the SDF spread and addresses the same atlas cell, so the fragment shader is unchanged.
