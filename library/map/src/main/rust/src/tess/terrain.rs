//! Tessellates a tile's ground into a DEM-displaced relief grid (WS-G, 3D terrain).
//!
//! Render-time only, like [`super::roof`]: the archive carries a per-tile `u16` heightmap in a
//! side table (metres above sea level, biased by 32768 — see
//! [`Heightmap`](tilecodec::mamaps::body::Heightmap)), never triangles. This module turns one
//! tile's heightmap into a regular grid of triangles whose per-vertex `z` rises and falls with the
//! terrain, so under camera tilt the ground shows real relief and occludes what sits behind a hill.
//!
//! # The terrain vertex
//!
//! Six floats — position with a height, plus a surface normal. Unlike a building it needs no
//! per-vertex colour: the whole ground is one style colour (the `earth` arm's, on the
//! `landtype` source since v8), pushed per draw,
//! and the relief is conveyed by shading that colour against the normal.
//!
//! | offset | floats | meaning                                                        |
//! |--------|--------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
//! | 0..12  | 3      | tile-local `(u, v, height)`; `u,v` in 0..1, `height` tile-norm  |
//! | 12..24 | 3      | surface normal in the same tile-local space, unit length       |
//!
//! `height` is **tile-normalised** — metres divided by the tile's own ground width, the same unit
//! `u`/`v` are — so the grid is zoom-independent like every other tile mesh, exactly as
//! [`super::roof`] normalises building heights. The terrain vertex shader multiplies it by the
//! tile's world-px span (a per-frame push scalar) to recover the world-px height the WS0
//! perspective matrix expects in its `z` input. At pitch 0 that matrix ignores `z` for `x`/`y`, so
//! the grid collapses to the flat footprint of the tile — the flat map the app has always shown.
//!
//! # The grid
//!
//! One vertex per heightmap sample (`dim * dim`), so the DEM is used at its own resolution with no
//! resampling, and `(dim - 1)^2` quads between them. Normals come from central differences of the
//! neighbouring heights (a standard heightfield normal), so a slope reads darker than a flat and
//! the relief is legible without any shadow pass. The differences read a 3×3-smoothed copy of the
//! height field — interior texels only, the border ring verbatim — so facet noise softens while
//! the two tiles sharing an edge smooth from the same edge samples and agree exactly. Positions
//! always carry the raw heights untouched. A tile whose samples are all equal (flat DEM, or
//! filled sea level) produces a flat sheet with every normal pointing straight up — indistinguishable
//! from the old flat ground once shading is disabled at pitch 0.
//!
//! # The skirt
//!
//! One vertical wall quad per edge segment, hung from the edge vertices straight down by
//! [`SKIRT_DEPTH`]. Neighbouring tiles sample the shared edge at
//! different resolutions (different LODs, different DEM dims), so under tilt the two displaced
//! edges part and the gap would show the clear colour through it; the skirts overlap instead,
//! and the seam reads as shaded earth. Each skirt vertex copies its edge vertex's `(u, v)` and
//! normal and differs only in `z`. Skirt vertices are appended after the grid vertices (and
//! skirt indices after the grid indices), so the grid prefix of both buffers is exactly the
//! triangulation described above, bit for bit.
