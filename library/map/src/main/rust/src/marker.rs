//! Dynamic map markers: the app's pins, and (WS-F) simulated transit vehicles.
//!
//! A marker is the sprite counterpart of the user puck ([`crate::vulkan::renderer::UserPuck`]):
//! a screen-anchored icon glued to a ground `lon`/`lat`, billboarded upright under tilt through
//! [`crate::camera::Camera::screen_quad_to_clip`], and drawn from the shared unit quad by the
//! sprite pipeline against the process-global sprite atlas ([`crate::tile::sprite`]). Moving the
//! pins into the renderer is what stops them trailing the basemap on a pan or a tilt the way the
//! Compose overlays did.
//!
//! # The shared contract with WS-F (transit vehicles)
//!
//! WS-F draws simulated transit vehicles through this same path: an [`crate::vulkan::renderer`]
//! `Overlay::Vehicles(Vec<Marker>)` variant beside `Overlay::Markers`, the same billboarded
//! sprite draw, and the same atlas. A vehicle is just a [`Marker`] whose [`icon`](Marker::icon)
//! names a mode sprite (bus/tram/train/ferry), so the bulk many-sprites case drops in with no new
//! machinery — only a new `Overlay` arm and a bulk setter. The icon ids WS-F needs are already
//! reserved in [`icon`] below.
//!
//! # Why an icon *id* rather than a name across the JNI boundary
//!
//! Kotlin passes a small integer per marker, not a string: the boundary stays allocation-free and
//! ABI-stable (see [`crate::bridge`]), and the atlas can grow — a dedicated pin sheet added on the
//! build side — without changing the JNI signature. The renderer resolves the id to a sprite-atlas
//! **name** here, and a name the sheet does not carry simply draws nothing, exactly as a POI with
//! no icon does ([`crate::tile::sprite::SpriteAtlas::get`]).
