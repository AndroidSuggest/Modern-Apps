//! The camera: a snapshot from Kotlin to a per-tile clip-space matrix.
//!
//! Web Mercator on a 512-logical-px tile grid (world = 512 * 2^zoom), matching
//! `:library:map`'s `Mercator.kt` — the Kotlin side owns the public `Projection`
//! in `Dp`, this side has to agree with it or every overlay drifts from the
//! basemap under it.
//!
//! 512 is also what gives MapLibre parity: the vector archives are authored on
//! that convention, so at the same zoom float a tile covers the same ground and
//! renders at the same size. This used to be a 256 grid with a compensating +1
//! zoom offset applied at the JNI boundary, which produced the right ground scale
//! by a different route but had two costs: tile addressing took the floor of the
//! *offset* zoom, so a screenful fetched four times as many tiles as MapLibre
//! does, and every style ramp — widths, `text_size`, opacity and the `min_zoom`
//! layer gating — was evaluated one level away from the zoom the authored
//! `basemap.json` those values were transcribed from meant by it.
//!
//! Only the camera crosses JNI, once per frame. Everything per-tile is derived here.

/// Logical pixels across one tile: 512, the convention the archives are authored on.
