/// Bumped only for a change a reader cannot ignore. The archive carries a
/// [`build_id`](crate::mamaps::header::Header::build_id) for "same format, different data".
///
/// v7 adds what the carriageway renderer needs to paint lane markings onto a road surface rather
/// than stroke parallel lines over it: a `FLAG_IS_ONEWAY` feature flag (bit 4), and one more
/// optional trailing body section behind `BODY_FLAG_ROAD_LANES` — a per-road **carriageway table**
/// (dense-parallel to the `roads` layer: the `lanes:forward`/`lanes:backward` split that says where
/// the centre line goes, and which dividers are solid) plus a per-tile **marking convention** byte
/// (left- or right-hand traffic, yellow or white centre line). The 24-byte feature record is
/// unchanged. The bump is forced twice over: an older reader rejects both an unknown body flag and
/// an unknown feature flag bit, so a v7 archive is a clean rejection rather than a wrong map.
///
/// v7 also adds the `junction` layer (id 11) to [`dict::LAYERS`](crate::mamaps::dict::LAYERS): one
/// `GEOM_LINE` feature per lane connector through an intersection, built from the same v6 routing
/// graph `traffic` reads. **That was only free because it landed inside v7's window.** Appending a
/// layer normally forces a bump of its own — v4 did exactly this for `traffic` — because `read`'s
/// `check_matches_schema` compares the whole dictionary on open, so every existing archive stops
/// opening. It cost nothing here only because v7 was committed but never built or shipped, leaving
/// no deployed reader to reject. The window shuts the moment a v7 archive exists: any layer added
/// after that costs v8.
///
/// v6 adds two optional trailing body sections behind new body flags: a per-building **S3DB
/// attribute table** (`BODY_FLAG_BUILDING_TABLE`, dense-parallel to the `buildings` layer —
/// heights, roof shape/height/direction/orientation and wall/roof colours for 3D extrusion) and a
/// per-tile **DEM heightmap** grid (`BODY_FLAG_HEIGHTMAP`, `u16` metres for 3D terrain relief).
/// The 24-byte feature record is unchanged, so the bump is not forced by the record width — it is
/// forced because an older reader rejects an unknown body flag, and would otherwise silently draw a
/// v6 tile flat. `Body::parse` refuses a version it does not speak, so an old v5 archive is a clean
/// rejection rather than a wrong map.
///
/// v5 bakes lane data into the `roads` layer: a per-feature **lane count** in the byte the
/// feature record kept reserved (byte 23), which the renderer expands into that many parallel
/// carriageway lanes with dividers at high zoom. The record width is unchanged, so the bump is
/// not forced by the dictionary (no new `kind`/`kind_detail`) — it is forced because an older
/// reader would read a v5 body's lane byte as the reserved zero it always was and draw every
/// multi-lane road as a single line. `Body::parse` refuses a version it does not speak, so the
/// mismatch is a clean rejection rather than a silently wrong map.
///
/// v4 adds the `traffic` layer (id 10) to [`dict::LAYERS`](crate::mamaps::dict::LAYERS): one
/// `GEOM_LINE` feature per drivable component segment of the v6 routing graph, each carrying
/// its packed `component_id` in the body id table. The layer addition alone forces the bump —
/// `read`'s `check_matches_schema` validates the whole dictionary on open, so an older reader
/// rejects a v4 archive anyway.
///
/// v3 adds `fuel`, `hotel` and `atm` to [`dict::KINDS`](crate::mamaps::dict::KINDS) and an optional
/// per-body feature id table. The kind additions alone force the bump: `read`'s
/// `check_matches_schema` validates the whole dictionary on open, so an older reader would
/// reject a v3 archive anyway. v1 is no longer read — the last v1 archive predates `places`,
/// `poi` and `transit` entirely.
///
/// The reader speaks v7 only: any other version byte is refused on open.
