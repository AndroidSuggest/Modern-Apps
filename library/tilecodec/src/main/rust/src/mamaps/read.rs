//! Reading a `.mamaps` archive over range requests.
//!
//! The cost contract, which is the reason the container is shaped the way it is:
//!
//! | | requests |
//! |---|
//! | open | 1 |
//! | a tile whose leaf is cached | 1 |
//! | a tile whose leaf is not | 2 |
//! | ever | never 3 |
//!
//! Open is one request because the header, the dictionary and the root index all fit inside
//! [`OPEN_PREFIX_BYTES`] and none of the three is compressed, so all three are used straight out
//! of the prefix. Sixteen cached leaves at 4096 entries each address 65 536 tiles with no
//! directory traffic at all, which matches the locality the transport was tuned around.
//!
//! **Every read takes its length from a header or entry field.** No sentinel, no length
//! discovered mid-stream, no read-until-it-looks-done — because the disk cache in `tile::cache`
//! only stores a `206` whose body length equals what was asked for, so a read of the wrong length
//! does not merely fail, it poisons that range for every later read.
//!
//! The reader speaks v8 only: a 128-byte header, 9 layers, full bodies. Anything else is
//! refused on open rather than reinterpreted.
