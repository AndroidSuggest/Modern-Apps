//! One tile body: every layer's geometry, flat and renderer-shaped.
//!
//! # What is not here
//!
//! **Triangles.** Pre-tessellating would bake the style's layer set into the data, so a restyle
//! would mean a rebuild — and the whole point of splitting one data-driven layer into several is
//! that it is a *paint* decision.
//!
//! **Points.** The renderer decodes them and throws them away, so they are not carried. A
//! geometry type is line or polygon and nothing else.
//!
//! **A property map.** A feature's whole attribute surface is `kind`, `kind_detail` and three
//! bits, because that is all the style filters on. No per-tile string table, no keys, no values.
//!
//! # Why all layers share one body
//!
//! Splitting per layer would multiply a cold tile's range requests by seven, and the renderer
//! wants every style layer for one tile at once anyway. One body, one request.
//!
//! # Layout
//!
//! ```text
//! [BodyHeader 16][LayerIndex × n][per layer: FeatureRecord[] PartEntry[] coord arena]
//! ```
//!
//! The fixed records are 4-byte aligned so a reader takes zero-copy slices of them.
//!
//! # Why coordinates are varints and everything else is not
//!
//! The first draft of this format stored the arena as flat `[i16 x, i16 y]` pairs, on the reasoning
//! that a zero-copy slice is the cheapest possible decode. Measured against the real published
//! archive that cost **1.72× the compressed bytes of the MVT it replaces**, consistently from z0 to
//! z14, because 87% of a body is coordinates and a fixed 4 bytes per point is simply worse than a
//! zigzag varint delta of 1 to 2. The interned dictionary is a real win — upstream `water` features
//! carry forty `name:*` localisations each — but it is not where the bytes are.
//!
//! So the arena is per-part zigzag varint deltas, which is what MVT does and for the same reason,
//! and it brings the format to 1.14× MVT. What is still won over MVT is the *decode*: no per-tile
//! string table, no property map, no `String` allocation per feature, and one flat `Vec` of points
//! per layer rather than a geometry-command walk per feature.
//!
//! Deltas restart at each part, so a part is independently decodable and a long line does not
//! accumulate a large running value.
//!
//! `raw_len` lives in the body header, which is **outside** the compressed frame, so a
//! decompressing reader knows the exact output size before it starts: an exact-length read from
//! the leaf entry and a single allocation from here.
