/**
 * Which part of a full equirectangular sphere a stored image actually covers.
 *
 * A full 360×180 capture is [full]. A partial pano — a phone sweep, say — stores
 * only the band it photographed, and the XMP `GPano` rectangle says where that
 * band sits inside the sphere it would have been part of. The uncovered rest of
 * the sphere renders black.
 *
 * The field order deliberately matches photos' `PanoData`, the XMP struct these
 * values are read out of. All six are `Int`, so an order of our own would make a
 * positional copy from that struct compile clean and silently transpose
 * left/top with width/height — a panorama that renders subtly wrong and traces
 * back to nothing. Keep them aligned.
