//! How many of a plan's barriers are real, and which fusions would pay.
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo run --offline --release -p modelrunner --example report_barriers
//! ```
//!
//! # Why
//!
//! `vulkan::run::Net::record` emits a `vkCmdPipelineBarrier` after **every** op, and on a Tensor
//! G4 that is 74% of a Supertonic utterance — 5,091 ms falling to 1,194 ms with the barriers taken
//! out. See `analysis/maml_vs_litert.md`.
//!
//! There are two ways to spend less on that, and this decides between them before either is
//! built:
//!
//! * **Emit fewer barriers for the same ops.** [`nets::schedule`] computes how many a
//!   dependency-correct recorder would need. If that is close to the op count the plan is serial
//!   and there is nothing to win, which is the likely answer for a ConvNeXt stack and the reason
//!   to measure before implementing.
//! * **Have fewer ops.** Every fused node removes a dispatch *and* a barrier. The adjacency table
//!   below ranks the candidates by how often each producer-consumer pair actually occurs, across
//!   every net rather than the one currently under the microscope.
//!
//! # No device, no downloads
//!
//! Runs on the host: it reads the `.maml` files committed to the repo and only builds plans, which
//! needs no Vulkan. Nets whose weights are a runtime download (Gemma 4, NLLB) are skipped with a
//! line saying so rather than failing the run.
