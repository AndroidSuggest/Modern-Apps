//! Opt-in timing, silent unless it is asked for.
//!
//! This runtime's cost is dominated by things that do not show up in a profile of the arithmetic —
//! serialising every op is expensive, though the size of that effect is **unmeasured**: the
//! no-barrier control delivered 43,008 frames against a correct run's 150,528, so it compared a
//! full utterance against a truncated one. The one valid same-work pair, `narrow` 2,179 ms against
//! `none` 1,160 ms at 43,008 frames each, puts it at 47% of a truncated run with a cheaper
//! barrier. See `analysis/maml_vs_litert.md` section 6; pinning the frame count so both paths do
//! identical work is task 11.
//!
//! Either way the numbers have to come from the runtime itself, and they are useless in aggregate:
//! "inference took 5.5 seconds" says nothing, while "the sampler ran 32 times at 158 ms of which
//! 96 ms was barriers" says everything.
//!
//! Switched on by `MODELRUNNER_TIMING` or `debug.modelrunner.timing`; see [`crate::knobs`] for
//! why there are two.
//!
//! Read once and cached. The answer cannot change usefully within a process, and this is called
//! from inside the per-op recording loop where a lookup per call would be part of what it is
//! trying to measure.
