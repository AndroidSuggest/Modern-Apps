//! NLLB's SentencePiece tokenizer: text to token ids and back.
//!
//! # What was inside the ncnn AAR
//!
//! There is no app-side tokenizer today — encode and decode both live in the `.so`, so a wrong
//! piece boundary could not be read, let alone tested. This is that code, in the open.
//!
//! # It is BPE, and the "scores" are merge ranks
//!
//! The model file is named `sentencepiece.bpe.model` and its `trainer_spec.model_type` is 2, BPE
//! (verified by model-eng with the existing `read_spm` parser: 256,000 pieces, scores 0..-255996).
//! Its pieces carry **negative merge ranks** rather than log probabilities, so encoding is greedy
//! pairwise merging — repeatedly join the adjacent pair whose concatenation is in the vocabulary
//! with the highest score, leftmost on a tie — and not the Viterbi a Unigram model would need.
//! Reading the scores as log probabilities and running Viterbi produces plausible pieces and the
//! wrong ones.
//!
//! # Normalisation is the caller's job
//!
//! The model's `normalizer_spec` is `nmt_nfkc` with a 237 KB `precompiled_charsmap`. Carrying
//! that in the APK is not worth it when the platform has
//! `java.text.Normalizer.normalize(text, Form.NFKC)`, so [`Table::encode`] takes text that is
//! **already NFKC** and does the rest: collapse whitespace runs, trim, prefix the metaspace and
//! substitute it for every space. Checked against the real `sentencepiece` on 20 samples across
//! Latin, Cyrillic, Arabic, Devanagari, Han, Kana, Hangul, fullwidth forms and emoji — NFKC plus
//! that whitespace handling agrees with `nmt_nfkc` on all of them.
//!
//! The table itself is `scripts/ml/nllb_tokenizer.py`'s output; see it for the format.
