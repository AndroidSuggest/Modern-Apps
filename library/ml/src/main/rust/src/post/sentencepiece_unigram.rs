//! The Unigram encoder for [`super::sentencepiece::Table`]: text to token ids by Viterbi.
//!
//! Split from `sentencepiece.rs` along the encoder line: that module keeps the BPE merge
//! loop, the table parser and decode; this one holds the Viterbi path T5/Unigram models
//! need. Both encode through the same [`MAX_PIECE_LEN`] bound and the same byte-fallback
//! table.
