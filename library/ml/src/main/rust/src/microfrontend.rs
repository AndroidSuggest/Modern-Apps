//! 16 kHz PCM to log-mel frames, on the CPU.
//!
//! A port of Google's TFLM "microfrontend" op chain — `Framer`, `Window`, `FftAutoScale`,
//! `Rfft`, `Energy`, `FilterBank`, `FilterBankSquareRoot`, `FilterBankLog` — which is the
//! front end of the Now Playing music models in [`crate::nets::nnfp`]. It is written against
//! a [`Config`] rather than against that one model, because the same chain is what any
//! keyword spotter or pitch tracker here would want.
//!
//! # Why this is not a shader
//!
//! One frame is a 512-point FFT and 119 multiply-accumulates: a few thousand flops every
//! 10 ms. The dispatch and readback of a compute pass would cost more than the arithmetic, and
//! the host is where a sign error in a window or an off-by-one in a filter bank actually gets
//! caught. [`crate::preprocess`] is not a shader for the same reason.
//!
//! # Fixed point, and where this deliberately leaves it
//!
//! The device pipeline is integer end to end. `FftAutoScale` finds the left shift `s` that puts
//! the loudest sample just below i16 full scale, applies it so the i16 FFT keeps its precision,
//! and hands `s` to `FilterBankSquareRoot`, which shifts it back out. Those two cancel exactly:
//! energy is `2^(2s) |X|^2` because the transform is linear and energy quadratic, its square
//! root is `2^s |X|`, and `>> s` recovers `|X|`. So block floating point buys precision for an
//! i16 FFT and changes nothing else. Computing in f32 makes it unnecessary, and this module
//! drops it. Two more integer stages go the same way: the u64 integer square root becomes
//! [`f32::sqrt`], and Google's fixed-point `Log32` polynomial becomes [`f32::ln`].
//!
//! What does **not** cancel is the fixed-point transform's own `1 / fft_size` attenuation, which
//! a float implementation must apply explicitly. See [`Config::fft_gain`].
//!
//! All three departures **reduce** error rather than introduce it, and `output_scale = 1600` —
//! which is what ties this front end to the networks, whose input quantises at exactly
//! `1 / 1600` — is preserved, because these values are in natural-log units either way.
//!
//! Two quantisations are kept, because they are not rounding error but what the signal has
//! actually become by the time a network sees it:
//!
//! * the `>> 12` after windowing, which is real quantisation of the windowed samples;
//! * the 12-bit truncated filter-bank weights, where `weights[j] + unweights[j]` is 4095 and
//!   not 4096.
//!
//! **This is therefore not bit-exact with the DSP, and has never been diffed against it.** It
//! is the same pipeline computed more accurately. The tests below check it against an
//! independently written reference for the pipeline as specified, which is a different and
//! weaker claim.
//!
//! # The tables are computed, not shipped
//!
//! [`mel_breakpoints`] and [`hann_window`] regenerate the six constant tensors that the Now
//! Playing `.tflite` carries as literals. The tests assert they reproduce those tensors **bit
//! for bit**, which is both the correctness check and the reason a caller may ask for different
//! band limits and still get a table the same code path would have produced. The mel arithmetic
//! must be f32 throughout: in f64 several breakpoints land one least-significant bit away,
//! because the truncation to 12 bits happens to sit on a boundary.
