/// Fold single-consumer `Quantize` nodes into their producing store.
///
/// A Gemma decode step spends 170 dispatches on int8 round-trips (`quantize.comp`):
/// the attention path runs at live's rounded precision, so every projection output
/// is `clamp(round(x / scale), -128, 127) * scale` before its consumer reads it.
/// Each is elementwise over a tensor that already sits in cache, so the producing
/// convolution, norm or cached apply stores `quantize(value)` directly — via
/// `quant_store` in `common.glsl`, fed by [`Push::param0_bits`] — and the
/// `Quantize` node never becomes a dispatch.
///
/// The fold direction mirrors [`Builder::fuse_elementwise`](super::Builder::fuse_elementwise):
/// the consumer is absorbed into the producer's store, never materialising anything
/// new. And like that fold it runs to fixpoint before liveness, so the arena
/// packing sees the folded graph.
///
/// # What can fold, and what cannot
///
/// The producer must be a `ConvInt8` (which covers the int4, int8 and Q2_K
/// lowerings — all three emit through that node), `RmsNorm` or `AttnApplyCached`
/// node whose output the quantize is the only reader of, counted over node inputs
/// *and* plan outputs. Anything else keeps its `Quantize` as its own op.
///
/// `Node::Conv` (fp16) is deliberately not a producer: no `Quantize` input in
/// Gemma is an fp16 convolution's output, so including it would need quant hooks
/// in shaders with no consumer. A producer that already carries a fused scale
/// (a chained `quantize(quantize(x))`, which no net builds) keeps the outer one
/// rather than dropping a rounding.
///
/// Only `Quantize` folds. A fused multiply would round differently (see the
/// elementwise fold), and a quantize is already the outermost operation of the
/// store it joins: `quantize(activate(acc + bias) + res + shift)`, which is
/// exactly `quantize(add(conv, res))` — the add-fold was already exact, so
/// applying the round-trip to its sum is too.
///
/// # Fallback
///
/// Gated by [`quant_fold_on`]: `MODELRUNNER_QUANT_FOLD=0` (or
/// `debug.modelrunner.quant_fold=0` on Android) restores the discrete
/// `Quantize` dispatches. See [`crate::knobs`].
