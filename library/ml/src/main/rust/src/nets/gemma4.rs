//! Gemma 4 E2B instruction-tuned: the text decoder, in one `.maml`.
//!
//! # What it is
//!
//! `Gemma4ForConditionalGeneration`'s text tower, from
//! `onnx-community/gemma-4-E2B-it-ONNX`. 35 layers, `d_model` 1536, a 262,144-entry vocabulary,
//! and multi-query attention: **eight query heads against one key/value head**.
//!
//! # Two layer archetypes, not one
//!
//! The model is structurally two halves, and this is the fact the rest of the module is shaped
//! around. `config.json` calls it `num_kv_shared_layers: 20` and `use_double_wide_mlp: true`;
//! in the initializer table it is two different tensor counts:
//!
//! * **Layers 0..15 own a KV cache.** Sixteen tensors: `q/k/v/o` projections, `q_norm`, `k_norm`,
//!   five RMS norms, a `[1536, 12288]` fused gate-and-up projection over a 6144-wide inner
//!   dimension, its `[6144, 1536]` down projection, two per-layer-input tensors and a scalar.
//! * **Layers 15..35 have no K or V at all.** Thirteen tensors: no `k_proj`, no `v_proj`, no
//!   `k_norm`. They re-use an earlier layer's cache, and spend the parameters on an MLP of
//!   **twice** the inner width - `[1536, 24576]` over 12288, down from `[12288, 1536]`.
//!
//! So the two halves trade key/value projections for feed-forward width. A single parameterised
//! layer function would have to carry that as a flag through every shape; two functions say it
//! once. See [`OWNS_CACHE_LAYERS`].
//!
//! # Which cache a shared layer reads
//!
//! Traced from the export's own graph rather than assumed:
//!
//! * The sliding shared layers - 15..19, 20..24, 25..29, 30..34 excluding the full ones - all
//!   read **layer 13**, the last sliding layer that owns a cache.
//! * The full-attention shared layers - 19, 24, 29 and 34 - read **layer 14**, the last full
//!   layer that owns one. In the graph they have no key transpose at all, and one mask where a
//!   sliding layer has two.
//!
//! # Sliding and full attention
//!
//! [`LAYER_TYPES`] alternates four sliding layers to one full one, so 4, 9, 14, 19, 24, 29 and 34
//! are full and the other 28 are sliding over a 512-position window. They differ in **head
//! dimension** as well: 256 sliding, 512 full, which is why `q_proj` is `[1536, 2048]` on one and
//! `[1536, 4096]` on the other. Everything else about them is the same.
//!
//! # The attention scale is already in `q_norm`
//!
//! The export applies **no** scale between the query projection and the score matmul - there is
//! no multiply or divide in the graph there, and the fused `GroupQueryAttention` nodes carry
//! `scale = 1.0`. The `1 / sqrt(head_dim)` is folded into `q_norm`'s gamma.
//!
//! [`Builder::attn_scores_cached_grouped`] supplies `1 / sqrt(head_dim)` itself, so a forward pass
//! that also uses the exported `q_norm` unchanged would apply it **twice** - which is not a shape
//! error and not a crash, just quietly flatter attention. The converter divides it out; see
//! [`Q_NORM_CARRIES_SCALE`].
