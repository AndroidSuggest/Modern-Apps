//! A CPU implementation of every op, and an interpreter that runs a [`Plan`] on the host.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Until now nothing checked the *numbers* this runtime produces. Both shipping nets
//! emit a segmentation mask, and a mask is confirmed by looking at it — so a
//! transposed kernel, a half-pixel shift or a misread group count would show up as a
//! slightly worse matte on one driver and nothing at all in CI.
//!
//! That was defensible for two nets whose output is an image. It stops being
//! defensible for the models this runtime is growing into: a face embedding that is
//! quietly wrong corrupts clustering with no visible symptom, and a CTC decode that is
//! one logit out returns confident nonsense. So every op gets a reference here, and
//! every op's semantics get pinned by a fixture that was computed by hand rather than
//! by running this code.
//!
//! # What it is a reference *for*
//!
//! Not for the shaders — they cannot run on the host, so this cannot diff against
//! them. It is a reference for the **plan**: [`super::Builder`] resolves shapes, group
//! splits, pads and arena offsets, and running the resolved [`Push`] blocks through an
//! independent implementation is what shows that arithmetic is right end to end.
//!
//! The op bodies below are written from ONNX's definitions. Where they agree with the
//! corresponding `.comp` file that is the result being asserted, not a shortcut: the
//! shader is the thing under test, and a fixture that was derived from it would test
//! nothing.
//!
//! # fp16 storage, fp32 arithmetic — reproduced exactly
//!
//! The shaders keep activations and weights in fp16 and accumulate in fp32.
//! [`Reference`] holds its arena as `f32`, but **every store is round-tripped through
//! fp16 first**, so each value is exactly the one the device would hold. Accumulation
//! order matches the shaders' loop nesting too, which is what makes a bit-for-bit
//! comparison against a device run meaningful rather than approximate.
//!
//! # Test-only
//!
//! `#[cfg(test)]`, so none of it reaches the shipped `.so`.
