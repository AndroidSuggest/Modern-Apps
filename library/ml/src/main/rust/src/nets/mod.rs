//! The two hardcoded forward passes, and the small compiler they are written against.
//!
//! # Why a plan and not a graph interpreter
//!
//! Each network is code: [`u2netp::build`] and [`selfie::build`] call [`Builder`] in
//! the order the ONNX nodes run. There is no operator table, no name lookup and no
//! topology in the weights file — a `.maml` is ordered tensors and nothing else.
//!
//! But the *shape* of the pass being code does not mean the offsets should be. So a
//! builder call records a [`Node`] against symbolic tensor ids, and [`Builder::finish`]
//! then does three things a hand-written pass would get wrong:
//!
//! 1. Propagates shapes, so every conv's output size is derived from its pads,
//!    stride and dilation rather than restated.
//! 2. Computes each tensor's last use and packs the arena with a free list, so U^2-Netp
//!    at 320x320 reuses memory instead of holding every intermediate at once.
//! 3. Resolves everything to `u32` element offsets in one place, which is the
//!    arithmetic the host tests check.
//!
//! The result is a flat [`Plan`] of [`Op`]s. `vulkan::run` records it into **one**
//! command buffer once, at construction, so an inference is an upload, one submit and
//! one readback — nothing here runs per frame.
//!
//! # Host-testable
//!
//! Nothing in this module or its children touches Vulkan. Builders take a
//! [`WeightSource`] rather than a [`crate::weights::Weights`], so `cargo test` builds
//! both real networks, in full, with no device and no asset.

/// A CPU implementation of every op, to check the resolved plans against. Test-only,
/// so it adds nothing to the shipped `.so`.
