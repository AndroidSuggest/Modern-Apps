//! TinyCLIP-ViT-8M/16 Text-3M: an image tower and a text tower, in one `.maml`.
//!
//! # What it is
//!
//! Two transformers that project into a shared 512-d space, which `:photos` compares with a cosine
//! for semantic search. Both are width 256 with 4 heads of 64 and a 1024-wide feed-forward; the
//! vision tower is 10 layers over 16x16 patches of a 224x224 image, the text tower 3 causal layers
//! over up to 77 tokens. 23,446,016 parameters, 22.6 MiB as int8.
//!
//! It replaces onnxruntime running `photos/src/main/assets/clip/model_int8.onnx`. That export was
//! also int8, so this is not a size win on the weights — the APK shrinks because the
//! `onnxruntime-reduced-android` AAR's 10.5 MB of arm64 `.so` leaves with it. See
//! `photos/src/main/assets/clip/README.md` for why the `.maml` is built from the **fp32** graph
//! even though the shipped one was already quantised.
//!
//! It is also *more* accurate than what it replaces. Cosine of the normalised 512-d embedding
//! against the fp32 export is 0.999864 for an image and 0.999394 for a query, against the shipped
//! int8 file's 0.998478 and 0.982881 — the text tower's gap is the 49,408-row token table, which
//! that export quantised per *tensor* with a zero point and this one quantises per row. Measured by
//! `scripts/ml/onnx_parity.py tinyclip` and `tinyclip_text`.
//!
//! # One file, two passes
//!
//! [`Mode`] selects which of them [`build`] emits. Unlike SMaLL-100's three passes the two towers
//! share **no weights at all** — they share a file, and therefore one upload and one
//! [`crate::vulkan::run::Net`]. Each pass names the other's tensors with
//! [`Builder::host_tensor`], and `tests::the_passes_cover_the_file_and_every_one_of_them_builds` is
//! what keeps that from hiding a genuinely unread layer.
//!
//! # Pooling is on the host, and both towers pool a different position
//!
//! The vision tower pools the **class token**, position 0, and the text tower the **end-of-text
//! position**. In this runtime's `[d_model, 1, T]` layout a position is a *column*, so it is
//! strided rather than contiguous and there is no cheap device-side gather of one.
//!
//! Both plans therefore run `post_layernorm` / `final_layer_norm` and the 256 -> 512 projection
//! over **every** position and let the host read the column it wants. That is exact: a layer norm
//! is per position and a `1 x 1` convolution is per position, so column `p` of the output is what
//! the reference computes from position `p` alone. It costs 197 projections instead of one in the
//! vision tower, which is 25.8 of its 1,500 million multiply-accumulates.
//!
//! Getting the two the wrong way round, or pooling a mean, produces 512-d vectors that normalise
//! cleanly and are simply wrong. There is no shape that catches it.
//!
//! # `pre_layrnorm`
//!
//! The vision tower normalises **before** the transformer stack as well as after it, and upstream
//! misspells it — `CLIPVisionTransformer.pre_layrnorm`, with the `e` missing. The name is kept as
//! the export has it. Missing the layer entirely is, again, a plausible-looking embedding.
//!
//! # The text tower is causal, and only needs `eot + 1` positions
//!
//! Its three layers attend over the whole sequence at once behind a causal mask, which is
//! [`crate::nets::Kind::SoftmaxCausal`]. The mask is also why [`Mode::Text`] takes a length: the
//! pooled position can only read positions before it, so running `eot + 1` positions instead of the
//! tokenizer's padded 77 gives the **identical** vector for a quarter of the work on a typical
//! query. `ClipEmbedder` passes an all-ones attention mask, which combines with the causal mask to
//! no effect, so nothing else depends on the padding being present.
//!
//! # The attention scale is already the model's
//!
//! `CLIPAttention` scales the query by `head_dim ** -0.5`, and `head_dim` is 64, so the export's
//! own constant is 0.125 — exactly what [`Builder::attn_scores`] applies. Nothing folds a query
//! scale, and folding one would apply it twice.
//!
//! # The token embedding is gathered on the host
//!
//! There is no int8 `embed.comp`, and there does not need to be: CLIP's text positions are a
//! **learned table**, so a token's input vector is a function of one embedding row and one position
//! row. [`embed_positions`] reads both and adds them in f32, exactly as
//! `nets::nllb::embed_positions` does, and hands the result in as an ordinary fp16 plan input.
//!
//! The cost is that the 12.6 MiB table is uploaded to the device and never read by a shader. It
//! stays in this file anyway: splitting it out would mean a second `.maml`, a second graph id and a
//! second asset for a tower that runs once per search query.
