//! whisper-base: a 30-second audio encoder and a KV-cached decoder, in one `.maml`.
//!
//! # What it is
//!
//! An encoder-decoder transformer over log-mel spectrograms: a two-convolution stem that turns
//! `[80, 3000]` mel frames into 1500 positions, then 6 encoder layers; 6 decoder layers with self
//! and cross attention; `d_model` 512, 8 heads of 64, a 2048-wide feed-forward, and a 51,865-entry
//! vocabulary shared between the input embedding and the logits projection. 72,593,920 parameters,
//! 70.6 MiB as int8.
//!
//! It replaces onnxruntime running two int8 ONNX exports totalling 76.9 MB
//! (`speech/src/main/assets/whisper-base/*.onnx`), and with them the last third-party inference
//! runtime in the tree. `:speech` used the **reduced** `onnxruntime-reduced-android` build, so what
//! actually left is 10,466,856 bytes of arm64 `.so` — about 3.6 MiB deflated in the APK — against the
//! 797 KB `libmodelrunner.so` that was already there for Supertonic. The release APK went from
//! 188.1 MiB to a measured **181.8 MiB**; the weights are most of both numbers.
//!
//! It is also **four times closer** to the fp32 checkpoint than what it replaces. Over the encoder's
//! `[1500, 512]` output on one deterministic window, against an fp32 reference computed from the
//! checkpoint directly:
//!
//! | | max | mean | correlation |
//! | :--- | ---: | ---: | ---: |
//! | the shipped `encoder_model_int8.onnx` | 14.33 | 0.1101 | 0.995204 |
//! | this `.maml` | **3.19** | **0.0293** | **0.999633** |
//!
//! on a tensor whose largest value is 22.8. That gap is per-output-channel quantisation against the
//! export's per-tensor dynamic quantisation, the same difference `nets::nllb` was ported for.
//! `scripts/ml/onnx_parity.py whisper` reproduces the middle column of it.
//!
//! # The arithmetic, measured rather than estimated
//!
//! ~43.7 GMAC per 30-second window in the encoder, regardless of how much speech is in it: 7.02 GMAC
//! per layer — 1.57 in the four projections, 3.15 in the feed-forward and 2.30 in the
//! `[8, 1500, 1500]` attention — plus 1.55 in the conv stem. A decode step is 60 MMAC by comparison.
//! Whether that is usable is a device question and the one open item in this port.
//!
//! # One file, two passes
//!
//! [`Mode`] selects which. They share the file because the embedding is **tied**: it is the
//! decoder's input table and the logits kernel, and two files would upload 26.6 MB of it twice. At
//! 51,865 x 512 that binding is well inside `maxStorageBufferRange`'s guaranteed 128 MiB, so unlike
//! `nets::nllb`'s 256,206-row head it needs no class split.
//!
//! # The encoder produces the cross-attention keys and values, not the hidden states
//!
//! Whisper's cross-attention reads the encoder output through each decoder layer's own `k_proj` and
//! `v_proj`, and those depend on nothing that changes between steps. Recomputing them per step is
//! what `nets::nllb` does, and it is fine there because a source sentence is tens of positions.
//! Here it is **1500**: twelve `512 x 512` projections over 1500 positions is 4.7 GMAC *per decode
//! step*, against the 26.5 MMAC of the logits head. That is 177 times the head, and at 224 tokens it
//! is a thousand GMAC.
//!
//! So [`Mode::Encode`] runs them once and hands back **twelve** `[512, 1, 1500]` tensors, and
//! [`Mode::DecodeStep`] takes them as inputs. The host then re-uploads 18.4 MB per step, which at a
//! few GB/s is an order of magnitude cheaper than recomputing them — measured against arithmetic, not
//! on a device, and flagged for the device. Nothing is transposed: a single-query cross-attention
//! reads a channel-major sequence through the ordinary [`Builder::attn_scores`] pair, exactly as
//! `nets::nllb`'s does.
//!
//! # The two position tables go opposite ways
//!
//! Both are real tensors in the checkpoint, not computed sinusoids. The **encoder's** `[1500, 512]`
//! is added to the conv stem's output, which is a device tensor, so the converter transposes it to
//! `[512, 1, 1500]` and it arrives as a [`crate::nets::Kind::Constant`]. The **decoder's**
//! `[448, 512]` is added to a gathered embedding row on the *host*, in f32, as
//! [`embed_positions`] does — so it is left `[448, 512]` and never reaches a shader.
//!
//! There is no `sqrt(d_model)` on the embedding: `config.json` has `scale_embedding: false`.
//!
//! # The conv stem's stride is what sets the sequence length
//!
//! `conv1` is `1 x 3` stride 1 and `conv2` is `1 x 3` **stride 2**, both `same`-padded, both
//! followed by GELU. 3000 mel frames therefore become 1500 encoder positions. A wrong stride gives
//! the right rank and the wrong length, and nothing downstream checks the length — which is why
//! `tests::the_conv_stem_halves_the_frame_count` pins it.
//!
//! `conv2` is 1.18 GMAC on [`crate::nets::Kind::ConvInt8`]'s untiled path, because the tiled int8
//! shader is `1 x 1` only. Flagged to measure rather than pre-optimised.
//!
//! # No attention mask, and none needed
//!
//! * The encoder attends over one 30-second window with no padding, so every key is real.
//! * The decoder decodes one token at a time, so a step is **one query against `cache_len + 1`
//!   keys**, which is causal by construction. That is what [`Builder::attn_scores_cached`] is for.
//! * The cross-attention is one query over all 1500 encoder positions.
//!
//! [`Builder::attn_scores`] applies `1 / sqrt(head_dim)` itself and `head_dim` is 64, which is
//! exactly `WhisperAttention`'s own scaling. So nothing folds a query scale.
//!
//! # Pre-norm
//!
//! `WhisperEncoderLayer` and `WhisperDecoderLayer` normalise **before** each sublayer and skip
//! around both, and each stack ends with one more layer norm. Written the other way round the net
//! still runs and still produces words.
