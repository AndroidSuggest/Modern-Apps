//! Which of a plan's barriers are actually needed.
//!
//! [`super::Plan`]'s `ops` field says "each depends on the results of the ones before it", and
//! [`crate::vulkan::run::Net::record`] takes it literally: a `vkCmdPipelineBarrier` after every
//! op. That claim is false in general, and serialising every op is expensive — but the **size of
//! the effect is unmeasured**. This header used to say 5,091 ms falling to 1,194 ms, 74% of an
//! utterance at about 0.55 ms a barrier. That came from a no-barrier control which delivered
//! 43,008 frames against a correct run's 150,528, so it set a full utterance against a truncated
//! one; the comparison captures output length at least as much as barrier cost.
//!
//! The one valid same-work pair is `narrow` at 2,179 ms against `none` at 1,160 ms, both at
//! 43,008 frames — a 47% delta, at a truncated workload and with a barrier cheaper than the
//! default, so it is a lower bound. A valid ceiling needs the frame count pinned so both paths do
//! identical work; that is task 11. See `analysis/maml_vs_litert.md` section 6.
//!
//! None of which changes what this module is for: whatever a barrier costs, emitting one that is
//! not needed costs all of it for nothing.
//!
//! This module answers the narrower question the runtime should have been asking: given what each
//! op reads and writes, which pairs actually have to be ordered.
//!
//! # Three hazards, not one
//!
//! It is tempting to track only read-after-write. That is wrong here, because
//! [`super::Builder::finish`] packs the arena with a best-fit coalescing free list that
//! **recycles offsets** as tensors die. Two ops with no path between them in the graph can
//! therefore land on the same bytes, and then:
//!
//! * **RAW** — the later op reads what the earlier wrote. The obvious one.
//! * **WAR** — the later op overwrites a range the earlier is still reading. Without a barrier the
//!   earlier op reads the new value.
//! * **WAW** — both write the same range and the survivor is whichever finishes last.
//!
//! Working from offsets rather than from the graph is what makes this safe: recycling is exactly
//! the case a graph-based analysis would call independent and get wrong. It costs some
//! pessimism — a barrier between two ops that only share a range by coincidence — and that is the
//! right direction to be wrong in.
//!
//! # Everything unknown is a barrier
//!
//! [`Kind::arena_reads`] returns [`Reads::Unknown`] for any kind whose reads have not been checked
//! against its shader, and an unknown read forces a flush. So does an op whose write range does
//! not fit the arena, and so does anything involving a transfer. The failure mode of this module
//! is a barrier that was not needed; it must never be a barrier that was.
