//! Maia3-5M: a human-move predictor for `:games:chess`, one forward pass per move.
//!
//! # What it is
//!
//! An encoder-only transformer over 64 tokens, one per square — the "Chessformer" of
//! <https://github.com/CSSLab/maia3>. Width 256, 8 blocks, 8 heads of 32, a 512-wide
//! feed-forward. 5,230,084 parameters, 6.8 MiB as int8 once the shared attention-bias kernel
//! is replicated (see below).
//!
//! It replaces Stockfish, which searched to depth 8 behind an 86 MB NNUE. This searches
//! nothing at all: the board goes in, 4352 move logits come out, and the app masks them to
//! its own legal move list and samples. That is the point of the model — it is trained to
//! predict what a *human of a given rating* plays, so a weak setting blunders the way a
//! beginner does rather than the way a crippled search does.
//!
//! # Strength is an input, not a handicap
//!
//! `SelfElo` and `OppoElo` are 0..5000 and enter as a linear blend of two learned
//! 128-vectors, concatenated onto every square's token. One weights file therefore covers
//! every difficulty; see [`elo_embedding`], and note its inverted naming.
//!
//! # The history is the current position, eight times
//!
//! The model takes 8 plies of history as 96 planes. The shipped `maia3-5m` launcher runs
//! with `use_uci_history=False`, and in that mode upstream seeds its deque with the current
//! position alone and pads by repeating it — so the 96 planes are the current position
//! eight times over. [`tokens`] builds exactly that, which is what makes parity against the
//! preset meaningful and means the app needs no move history.
//!
//! Real 8-ply history is deliberately not implemented: in `use_uci_history` mode each
//! historical position is mirrored by *its own* side to move, so the perspective alternates
//! every ply, and that is easy to get quietly wrong for no gain over what ships.
//!
//! # Post-norm, and RMSNorm inside the block
//!
//! Two things differ from [`super::tinyclip`] and copying that file by reflex gets both
//! wrong. The blocks are **post-norm** — `x = norm(x + sublayer(x))`, not
//! `x = x + sublayer(norm(x))` — and the in-block norm is [`Builder::rms_norm`], which has
//! no mean subtraction and no beta. The two norms outside the stack are ordinary layer
//! norms. Neither mistake changes a single shape.
//!
//! # The attention bias, and why its kernel is replicated eight times
//!
//! Every block generates its own additive `[8, 64, 64]` bias from the board — upstream
//! calls it GAB, and the checkpoint calls it smolgen. The generator pools the squares to
//! `[256]`, runs it through two projections to `[512]`, reads that as `[8, 64]`, and
//! expands it with `einsum("bhi,oi->bho")` against a `[4096, 64]` weight **shared by all
//! eight blocks**.
//!
//! There is no transpose or permute op in this runtime — the layout inventory is
//! `reshaped` / `slice_channels` / `concat` / `concat_positions`, all relabels or copies —
//! so that einsum is expressed as a **grouped 1x1 convolution**: `group = 8`, 512 in,
//! 32768 out, kernel `[32768, 64, 1, 1]`. Group `g` reads input channels
//! `[g*64, (g+1)*64)` and writes `[g*4096, (g+1)*4096)`, which is the einsum with the
//! output already in `[8, 64, 64]` order.
//!
//! The cost is that the converter replicates the `[4096, 64]` weight eight times, +1.84M
//! elements. It is replicated **once, not per block**: the parameter is shared, so all eight
//! blocks pass [`SMOLGEN`] as their `weight_index`. Avoiding the replication would need a new
//! transpose shader, and the memory is the cheaper trade — more so at int8, where the
//! replicated kernel costs 2.1 MB rather than the 4.2 MB it would at fp16.
//!
//! # int8, and why not int4
//!
//! Every `1 x 1` convolution is [`Builder::conv_int8`], quantised per output channel from the
//! fp32 checkpoint. The norms, the biases and the two elo embeddings stay fp16 and together
//! are 1% of the parameters. 13.3 MiB to 6.8 MiB.
//!
//! Measured rather than assumed, by `scripts/ml/maia_quant_eval.py`. The worst per-tensor
//! correlation against fp32 is 0.999941, and over 400 positions at each of the four shipping
//! ratings the quantised model picks a different move 0.5% to 1.0% of the time — always where
//! the top two legal moves are within 0.017 of each other, which is inside the deviation fp16
//! rounding produces on its own.
//!
//! **int4 was measured and rejected.** At 4 bits the same harness agrees on 87% to 91% of
//! moves depending on the group size, and 14 to 29 of the disagreements are on margins wider
//! than fp16 rounding — the model changes its mind rather than losing a coin flip. Sub-row
//! grouping does not rescue it and gives back most of the saving (per-16 is 4.2 MiB against
//! per-channel's 3.5). 5.2M parameters have no redundancy to spare, unlike the large models
//! int4 is usually quoted for.
//!
//! The attention-bias kernel is 30% of the file and is read by every block, so int8 halves
//! this net's weight traffic as well as its size — the part that matters if a move ever feels
//! slow.
//!
//! # The bias is added after the scale
//!
//! [`Builder::attn_scores`] applies `1 / sqrt(head_dim)` itself, and the bias is added to
//! the result. That matches `F.multi_head_attention_forward`, which scales `q` before
//! adding `attn_mask` — so the bias is *not* scaled. Adding it first would divide it by
//! `sqrt(32)`.
//!
//! # What is not emitted
//!
//! The value (win/draw/loss) and ponder heads, and the `last_ln` in front of them. Neither
//! is needed to pick a move, the collector controls the tensor list, so they are simply not
//! in the file. An evaluation bar would want them back.
//!
//! # Move vocabulary
//!
//! [`build`] emits two tensors and `post::maia` assembles the 4352 logits from them:
//!
//! * `0..4095` — `from_square * 64 + to_square`, square `rank * 8 + file`, a1 = 0, h8 = 63
//! * `4096..4351` — `4096 + from_file * 32 + to_file * 4 + piece`, piece in q, r, b, n
//!
//! Promotions are always rank 7 to rank 8 because the board is mirrored for black.
