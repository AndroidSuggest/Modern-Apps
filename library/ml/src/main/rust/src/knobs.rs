//! Debug settings, read from the environment or from a system property.
//!
//! Two sources because there are two ways this code runs and neither covers the other:
//!
//! * `MODELRUNNER_<NAME>` in the environment. The measurement loop is the cross-compiled test
//!   binary, and `adb shell MODELRUNNER_TIMING=1 ./mr_test ...` is how it is set. Also the only
//!   one that works on a host build.
//! * `debug.modelrunner.<name>`, on Android. An app is not launched from a shell and has no
//!   environment to set, so an env var alone would leave the shipped path unmeasurable.
//!   `adb shell setprop debug.modelrunner.barrier global` reaches it.
//!
//! Every one of these is off by default and none changes what a release build computes. They
//! exist because this runtime's cost is concentrated somewhere a profile of the arithmetic does
//! not show — see `analysis/maml_vs_litert.md` — so the alternatives have to be switchable at run
//! time to be compared honestly. Rebuilding between variants is how the first attempt at this
//! measured a shader change and called it a barrier change.
//!
//! Callers cache their own answer. Nothing here does, because the lookups happen once per process
//! at a natural point and a shared cache would need a lock for no benefit.
