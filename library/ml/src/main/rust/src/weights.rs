//! The `.maml` reader.
//!
//! `.maml` is a **weights container only** — ordered tensors, no operators and no
//! topology — because each network's forward pass is hardcoded in [`crate::nets`]
//! rather than interpreted. Format version 2 appends an optional *graph section*
//! describing that forward pass symbolically (see [`Graph`]); version 1 files have
//! none, and behave exactly as before. See `scripts/ml/maml_convert.py`, which writes
//! it, for the byte layout; this is the other half of that contract.
//!
//! Two consequences worth stating plainly:
//!
//! * Tensor **order** is the whole interface. A reordering loads cleanly and infers
//!   nonsense, which is why the converter pins a SHA-256 over the ordered layer
//!   table and why [`Weights::graph_id`] is checked before a net will touch a file.
//! * Nothing here allocates or copies the tensor data. The whole file is uploaded to
//!   one `VkBuffer` verbatim, so a [`Tensor`]'s offset is simultaneously its offset
//!   in the file and its offset in device memory. That is the reason the format is
//!   one contiguous blob.
