//! The shaders, against [`crate::nets::reference`].
//!
//! Every parity number recorded for this runtime so far compares onnxruntime against the *host
//! interpreter*. That checks the forward passes in `nets/` — which is where the transcription
//! mistakes are — and says nothing whatever about the SPIR-V in `shaders/`, because until the
//! Vulkan layer built on the host there was no way to run it anywhere but a phone. A shader that
//! indexed a tensor wrongly would have shipped with every structural check green.
//!
//! So these run the same plan twice, once through `nets::reference` and once through
//! [`Net`], and require the two to agree. The interpreter is the oracle: it is the thing the
//! ONNX parity scripts already validated.
//!
//! # Running them
//!
//! `#[ignore]`d, because a host with no Vulkan must still pass `cargo test`:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo test -p modelrunner --lib -- --ignored vulkan::parity
//! ```
//!
//! # Running them segmented
//!
//! [`super::segment`] windows the weights buffer when it is larger than
//! `maxStorageBufferRange`, and on any device this runtime actually targets it never is — so the
//! windowed path would otherwise ship as dead code. Re-running the whole suite with the range
//! forced down exercises it against the same oracle:
//!
//! ```text
//! MODELRUNNER_MAX_STORAGE_RANGE=33554432 \
//!   cargo test -p modelrunner --lib -- --ignored vulkan::parity
//! ```
//!
//! Every number must be identical to the unforced run: windowing changes which descriptor set is
//! bound and what the three weights offsets in [`crate::nets::Push`] are measured from, and
//! nothing else. The variable is read once, when the [`Context`] is created, which is why it is set
//! on the command line rather than inside a test - the device here is process-wide and shared.
//!
//! # Running them on the phone
//!
//! A desktop GPU passing these says nothing about Adreno, which is the only device this runtime
//! actually ships to, and audio is far less forgiving of a shader that is subtly wrong than a
//! segmentation mask is. The test binary cross-compiles and runs from a shell, because `ash` loads
//! `libvulkan.so` at run time rather than linking it:
//!
//! ```text
//! NDK=$ANDROID_HOME/ndk/29.0.14206865/toolchains/llvm/prebuilt/<host>/bin
//! CARGO_TARGET_AARCH64_LINUX_ANDROID_LINKER=$NDK/aarch64-linux-android31-clang \
//!   cargo test --release -p modelrunner --lib --no-run --target aarch64-linux-android
//! adb push target/aarch64-linux-android/release/deps/modelrunner-<hash> /data/local/tmp/mr_test
//! adb shell chmod 755 /data/local/tmp/mr_test
//! adb shell /data/local/tmp/mr_test --ignored vulkan::parity
//! ```
//!
//! The fixtures above need no assets and so run anywhere. The one that reads the shipped `.maml`
//! needs them pushed, and returns quietly when they are absent rather than failing a run that never
//! had them:
//!
//! ```text
//! adb push speech/src/main/assets/supertonic /data/local/tmp/
//! adb shell MODELRUNNER_ASSETS=/data/local/tmp/supertonic \
//!   /data/local/tmp/mr_test --ignored --nocapture the_shipped_supertonic
//! ```
//!
//! # Tolerance
//!
//! Not exact equality. Both sides store activations as fp16, but a shader reduces in parallel
//! and the interpreter sums left to right, so a dot product of `k` terms can differ in the last
//! fp16 place. The comparison is therefore relative to the magnitude of the tensor rather than
//! absolute — an absolute threshold either passes everything for a small output or fails a large
//! one for nothing.
