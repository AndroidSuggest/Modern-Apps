//! Recording a [`Plan`] into one command buffer, and running it.
//!
//! # Recorded once, submitted per inference
//!
//! The whole network — 350 dispatches for U^2-Netp, 150 for the selfie net, with a barrier
//! between each — is recorded into a single primary command buffer at [`Net::new`] and
//! never re-recorded. An inference is then exactly:
//!
//! 1. preprocess the bitmap into the staging buffer on the CPU,
//! 2. one `vkQueueSubmit`,
//! 3. one `vkWaitForFences`,
//! 4. read the mask back out of the staging buffer.
//!
//! Nothing is allocated, no descriptor is written and no command is recorded per frame.
//! That is what makes this viable on `:camera`'s ~15 fps preview path, where the recording
//! cost — hundreds of `vkCmd` calls — would otherwise be paid 15 times a second while the
//! UI is also using the GPU.
//!
//! The input copy is *inside* the recorded buffer, so the host writes only to the staging
//! buffer and the GPU does the transfer into device-local memory itself.
//!
//! # Barriers
//!
//! One full barrier between every op, covering both the compute and transfer stages in
//! each direction. Every layer reads what the one before it wrote, into the same
//! `VkBuffer`, so there is no dependency to skip: the arena is a single buffer and a
//! finer-grained barrier would have to name byte ranges that the ops already overlap by
//! design. About 350 barriers per inference is the cost of that simplicity, and it is the
//! first thing to look at if U^2-Netp is slower than it should be.

/// 5,096 ms across the four correct variants on a Tensor G4, a spread of 0.45% against a noise
/// floor of 2%. Cost is also not proportional to the byte range — [`Formulation::Global`] names no
/// range at all and [`Formulation::Whole`] names the entire arena, and they land 4 ms apart. The
/// knob is kept so the sweep can be re-run on a new device, not because a winner is expected.
