//! Splitting the weights buffer into descriptor-sized pieces.
//!
//! # The problem
//!
//! Every shader reads the whole weights file through one descriptor whose `range` is the file's
//! length, and `maxStorageBufferRange` is only guaranteed to be **128 MiB**. SMaLL-100's weights
//! are 318 MiB. So on a device reporting the minimum, one descriptor cannot describe the file at
//! all: the binding would be invalid, and validation would say so while a release build read
//! whatever the driver felt like past the range.
//!
//! It is not new with SMaLL-100 either. Supertonic's fp16 sampler shipped at 121.7 MiB, 95% of the
//! guarantee, so this was one model away from breaking already.
//!
//! # One buffer, several descriptors
//!
//! The file stays a **single** `VkBuffer` and a single allocation — nothing about the upload,
//! [`crate::weights::Blob::read_at`] or `Net::CHUNK_BYTES` changes. What is split is the
//! *descriptor*: one set per segment, each pointing at the same buffer with its own
//! `(offset, range)`, and `Net::record` binds the set an op needs before dispatching it.
//!
//! Per-segment `VkBuffer`s would work too, and would sidestep `minStorageBufferOffsetAlignment`
//! entirely, at the price of N allocations, an upload that has to know which buffer each byte
//! belongs to, and N sets of aliasing rules. The alignment is not actually a problem: it is at
//! most 256, a segment base is a multiple of the window stride which is rounded down to it, and
//! the overlap that creates is read-only in every segment.
//!
//! # Overlapping windows, so the split does not depend on the plan
//!
//! The obvious segmentation is greedy over the ops: fill a descriptor until the next op's tensors
//! do not fit, then start another. It gives the fewest segments, and it is wrong here, because
//! [`super::run::Net::rebuild`] installs a **different plan** over the same weights. SMaLL-100's
//! encoder and decoder passes read different subsets of one file, so a plan-derived segmentation
//! would have to be recomputed on every rebuild, and a recomputation that wanted *more* segments
//! than the descriptor pool was allocated for could only fail.
//!
//! So the segments are fixed windows of `range` bytes at a stride of `range / 4`, covering the
//! file. Any byte span shorter than `range - stride`, which is three quarters of the range, is
//! then **entirely inside** at least one window: a span starting at `from` is inside window
//! `from / stride`, which reaches to `(from / stride) * stride + range`. The largest span any op
//! here has is one of SMaLL-100's two logits halves at 65.9 MB, against 100.7 MB of guaranteed
//! headroom.
//!
//! The cost of the overlap is descriptor sets, not memory: ten of them for a 318 MiB file at the
//! guaranteed range, one for the same file on a device reporting 4 GiB. Since it depends only on
//! the file's length, `rebuild` needs to recompute nothing.
//!
//! # What stays invisible
//!
//! [`crate::weights::Tensor::offset`] stays absolute and file-relative, and so does every offset
//! in a [`Plan`]. Nothing in `nets/` knows a segment exists, which is what keeps
//! `nets::reference` — the only oracle for the shaders — and every parity fixture unchanged.
//! Rebasing happens here, at record time, and is a pure function of the segment and the push.
//!
