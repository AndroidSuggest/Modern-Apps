/**
 * Gemma 4 E2B, running on this repo's Vulkan compute runtime.
 *
 * Replaces `com.google.ai.edge.litertlm`, and with it the 19.83 MB `liblitertlm_jni.so`. The
 * weights are the same model, converted to `.maml` by `scripts/ml/maml_convert.py --graph
 * gemma4_text` and `--graph gemma4_embed`, quantised to int4 with a per-block scale.
 *
 * # What moved out of the SDK and into here
 *
 * litertlm owned the chat template, the tool protocol, sampling and the streaming loop, and none
 * of that was visible from this repo. All four now live in Kotlin, which is the point: the
 * template is [render], the tool protocol is [declareTools] and [parseToolCall], the loop is
 * [generate]. Native's boundary is one token.
 *
 * # Behavioural differences from litertlm, which are real
 *
 * * **Sampling is the caller's.** litertlm used `top_k` 64 and `top_p` 0.95. [generate] steps
 *   greedily by default and samples through [MlNative.logitsGemma4] when a [Sampling] config is
 *   passed - chat turns use [Sampling.Chat] for the old behaviour, extraction stays greedy.
 * * **No speculative decoding**, which litertlm had enabled. [Gemma4NgramDraft] is the unwired
 *   spike: the drafter without the native parallel-scoring pass that would make it a win.
 * * **A hard context limit** of [MAX_CONTEXT] positions, where litertlm's was implicit.
 * * **Audio is fitted, not refused.** A clip past the reply reserve is trimmed from its end
 *   rather than failing the turn - see [fitAudio]. At this window a full 30 s clip fits against
 *   any realistic prefix, so a trim means a very long conversation, not a big prefix.
 *
 * # Threading
 *
 * Not thread-safe, and more sharply than [NllbHandle]: one handle holds one KV cache and one
 * position, so two concurrent turns would interleave their tokens into the same conversation.
 * The caller must hold a lock across a whole turn, not merely across a call.
