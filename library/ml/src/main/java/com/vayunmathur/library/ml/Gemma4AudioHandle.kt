/**
 * Gemma 4's audio tower: a waveform in, the soft tokens the decoder reads in its place.
 *
 * The sibling of [Gemma4VisionHandle]. [Gemma4Handle] is text-only; this produces the `[n, 1536]`
 * block that stands in for a clip in its prompt, and [Gemma4Handle.generate] splices it in.
 *
 * # A separate file and a separate handle
 *
 * The tower is its own `.maml` with its own graph id, downloaded separately. It is also the
 * largest of the three at 166 MB - bigger than the vision tower, because each of its twelve
 * layers carries two 4x feed-forwards plus a gated convolution module. A device that never sends
 * audio never fetches it, and a tower that fails to load leaves the assistant answering without
 * sound rather than taking it down.
 *
 * # Unlike the vision tower, there is no size to negotiate
 *
 * [Gemma4VisionHandle] has to ask native what to resize an image to, because the target is a
 * patch budget and being one block out changes the token count. Audio has no such choice: the
 * clip's own length decides, at one soft token per 40 ms. So [encode] takes samples and nothing
 * else.
 *
 * # What the caller owes
 *
 * 16 kHz mono, roughly -1..1. The front end has no gain of its own, so the scale it arrives in is
 * the scale the tower sees. Native truncates to [MAX_SAMPLES] and runs the log-mel itself.
 *
 * Do **not** pad the waveform. The reference pads to a multiple of 128 samples so a batch stacks
 * and then spends a validity mask through the whole tower undoing it; this runtime records a plan
 * per clip length and passes it at its true length, which was measured bit-identical against the
 * export. Padding here would silently append soft tokens of silence.
 *
 * # Threading
 *
 * Not thread-safe. A new clip length re-records the plan, so two concurrent encodes would race on
 * the recording.

         * This is the TOWER's limit and it knows nothing about the prompt it will be spliced

         * [Gemma4Handle.MAX_CONTEXT] of 16384. The fixed prefix was last measured at ~1871
         * positions (twenty-four tool declarations plus the system prompt); with twenty-five
         * tools today that figure has moved, so re-measure rather than trusting it. Even at a
         * rounded-up 2000, the room for audio under the default 512-position reply reserve is
         * `16384 - 512 - 2000 = 13872` positions - a full 30 s clip with an order of magnitude
         * to spare.
         *
         * (An earlier revision of this docstring did the same arithmetic against a 2048 window,
         * where the prefix left 174 positions and no clip worth sending fit. That window is
         * gone: both the Kotlin [Gemma4Handle.MAX_CONTEXT] and native `nets::gemma4::MAX_CONTEXT`
         * are 16384.)
         *
         * Over budget, [Gemma4Handle.generate] still trims audio rather than returning null, so
         * the turn survives - but with this much headroom a trim means the conversation has grown
         * very long, not that the prefix is too big.
         *
         * P moves whenever a tool is added or removed; re-measure rather than trusting the
         * figure above. The lever is the NUMBER OF TOOLS declared rather than the length of
         * their prose - declaring three tools instead of twenty-five frees far more than
         * deleting every description.
         *
         * **The caller must budget.** Shortening this constant would be the wrong fix: the
         * headroom depends on the prompt, which this class cannot see.
         *
         * Reclaiming the prefix means **emitting fewer tokens**, not prefilling the same ones
         * faster. Caching the declaration prefix's KV would make turn two cheap and would free
         * no context at all - the positions are still occupied, so the budget above is
         * unchanged. Only shrinking the prefix moves it.
