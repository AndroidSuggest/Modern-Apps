/**
 * On-device translation into 400+ languages: MADLAD400-3B-MT on the
 * Vulkan compute runtime.
 *
 * MADLAD-400 trained for MT: 32 encoder layers, 32 decoder layers, `d_model` 1024,
 * 16 heads of `d_kv` 128, an 8192-wide gated-GELU feed-forward — and a 256,000-entry
 * vocabulary with **untied** embeddings. T5 relative position biases are computed on
 * the host per shape and uploaded as plan inputs. See
 * `library/ml/src/main/rust/src/nets/madlad.rs`.
 *
 * # Two files, downloaded rather than bundled
 *
 * `madlad400.maml` and `tokenizer.bin`, far too much to ship inside an APK — hence
 * [inDirectory] and no asset path. Each untied table is emitted as four head-split
 * tensors over disjoint 64,000-class ranges (256,000 classes at 1024 channels exceeds
 * `maxStorageBufferRange` in one buffer), and the tokenizer table holds the 256,000
 * Unigram pieces.
 *
 * # One target tag, not two language tokens
 *
 * MADLAD prefixes the **target** tag (`<2en>`) to the encoder source and starts the
 * decoder unforced from `<unk>` — unlike NLLB's source-token + forced-BOS-target pair.
 * Backwards, it produces fluent output in the wrong language rather than an error —
 * which is why [translate] takes a target tag rather than bare ids and resolves it
 * through [com.vayunmathur.translate.platform.MadladModel.targetTag].
 *
 * # Normalisation
 *
 * The model's normaliser is the identity, so [translate] does NOT NFKC-normalise —
 * normalising would retokenise text the model was trained to see raw. It only
 * collapses runs of spaces (HuggingFace's T5 prefix normaliser), which native does
 * not do.
 *
 * # Availability
 *
 * Construction never throws. [isAvailable] is false when `libmodelrunner.so` is missing
 * for this ABI, when either file is absent or malformed, or when the device cannot give
 * us a Vulkan device with fp16 compute — and then [translate] returns null.
 *
 * # Threading
 *
 * Not thread-safe, and more sharply than the other handles here: a translation re-records
 * the network once per decoded token, so two concurrent calls would interleave recordings
 * of the same command buffer. A caller must hold a lock across [translate] and [close].
