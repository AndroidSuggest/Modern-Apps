/**
 * Opens the app's own settings when the system launched it to do exactly that.
 *
 * Android's App Info screen shows an entry pointing back into an app's
 * settings, but only if the app advertises one with an
 * [Intent.ACTION_APPLICATION_PREFERENCES] filter. Declaring the filter is half
 * the job: without this, tapping that entry drops the user on the home screen
 * instead, which is worse than not offering it at all.
 *
 * Call once from the composable that owns the back stack:
 *
 *     backStack.openSettingsIfRequested(Route.Settings)
 *
 * Deliberately a push rather than a stack reset, so back returns to the app's
 * home screen rather than closing it - the user arrived from outside and has
 * nowhere else to go back to.
