/**
 * The bottom navigation bar, shared by every app.
 *
 * Built on the short navigation bar so the height is the same everywhere; the
 * apps previously used a mix of `FlexibleBottomAppBar` (deliberately
 * variable), the 80dp `NavigationBar`, and this, so bars visibly changed
 * height from app to app.
 *
 * Rides above the keyboard, which is handled here rather than at each call
 * site because the bar has to work in both the places apps put it: some pass
 * it to [MainNavigation]'s `bottomBar` slot, which sits outside the content
 * and gets no inset handling of its own, and others render it inside a page.
 * That slot is why the app store's bar stayed behind the keyboard while the
 * contacts one, drawn inside the page, moved with it.
 *
 * The inset is the union of the bar's normal one and the keyboard rather than
 * the two added together. A visible keyboard already covers the navigation
 * bar, so padding for both would leave the bar floating a navigation bar's
 * height above the keyboard.
 *
 * Takes a content slot rather than a fixed item model because the apps
 * navigate in genuinely different ways - a route back stack, a tab enum, a
 * selected index. Use [BottomNavBarItem] for each entry; there is a
 * [BottomNavBar] overload below for the common back-stack case.
