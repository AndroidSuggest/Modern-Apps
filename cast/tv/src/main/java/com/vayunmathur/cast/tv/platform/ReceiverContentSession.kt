 * key frame, and there is no picture-loss indicator to send because there are no lost pictures.
 * What is left is a URL, a pinned certificate and a player that owns its own clock.
 *
 * **And because it owns the clock, it owns the truth.** A reporting coroutine puts this player's
 * state on the channel - immediately when something changes, and otherwise at
 * [REPORT_HEARTBEAT_MS] - which is what lets every surface on the phone show what is actually
 * playing. `PLAYBACK_COMMAND` arrives here rather than leaving, for the same reason.
 *
 * ExoPlayer must be built and driven from the thread whose looper it took, so every call into it
 * hops to the main thread. The control channel stays on this coroutine, because it is the same
 * blocking read it always was.
 *
 * Returns true when the phone ended the *session* and wants to keep the connection, so the caller
 * can go back to waiting for the next configuration.

 * not need them faster.
 *
 * The heartbeat underneath is what makes the whole thing self-repairing: every message is an
 * absolute snapshot, so a lost one costs at most one interval of staleness and needs no
 * acknowledgement, no sequence number and no retry.
 *
 * Each snapshot is also published locally, because this box draws its own overlay from the same
