/**
 * Store listing images for `:appstore`, rendered from Compose previews instead of from
 * an instrumented test on a device.
 *
 * `./gradlew :appstore:metadata` renders these and copies the PNGs into
 * `metadata_data/photos/appstore/`, where `release.sh` picks them up.
 *
 * Two things to keep in mind when editing:
 *
 *  - Order matters, and it comes from the function names. The generated PNG filenames
 *    embed the function name, so `Preview1Home`/`Preview2Detail`/... sort into listing
 *    order no matter how the plugin formats the rest of the filename. Renumber the
 *    functions if you reorder the listing.
 *  - Everything must be a literal. These render with no ViewModel, no database and no
 *    network, so the state below is the whole input — which is also what makes the output
 *    reproducible from a clean checkout. In particular no preview can show a screenshot
 *    or a remote icon, since both would need a fetch.
 *  - Each preview needs @PreviewTest as well as @Preview. @Preview alone renders in
 *    Studio but is not collected as a screenshot test, and the build fails with the
 *    unhelpful "did not discover any tests".
 *  - The previews must be members of a class, not top-level functions. Android Studio
 *    renders top-level previews happily, but the screenshot engine discovers previews as
 *    JUnit tests and needs a real class to attach them to — top-level functions land in a
 *    synthetic `…Kt` facade and are silently skipped.
 *
 * The last slot goes to the "how apps are checked" page, because comparing what each
 * source actually guarantees is the thing that distinguishes this store from any other
 * F-Droid or Play client.
