/**
 * Verifies the signed `entry.jar` that authenticates an F-Droid repository's index-v2.
 *
 * This is the check that makes everything downstream mean anything: the per-APK SHA-256
 * and `signer` fingerprints only bind the APK to the index, so an index we haven't
 * authenticated could simply state a hostile APK's own hash and key. Pinning the index
 * signing certificate is what stops a malicious mirror from rewriting both sides.
 *
 * [JarFile] with verification enabled checks the PKCS#7 signature block against the
 * per-entry digests in `META-INF/MANIFEST.MF` as entries are read — but only for entries
 * that are actually consumed, and an unsigned entry simply reports no certificates. Hence
 * [readVerified] reads the entry to completion first and treats a missing certificate as
 * a failure rather than as "unsigned but fine".
