/**
 * The UI contract for the screens the store listing images are rendered from.
 *
 * Those screens take state values plus an actions interface rather than [TravelViewModel]
 * and the nav back stack, so they can be rendered by a `@Preview` — see
 * `src/screenshotTest`. The `*Page` composables stay as thin binders over the ViewModel;
 * everything below lives in `util` alongside the existing `*State` classes, so `ui` depends
 * on `util` and never the reverse.
 *
 * Navigation is part of the actions rather than a separate set of lambdas: every one of
 * these screens has a back arrow plus at least one forward destination, and the binder is
 * the single place that knows about both the ViewModel and the back stack.
