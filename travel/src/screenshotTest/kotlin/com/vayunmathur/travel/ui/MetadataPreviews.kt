/**
 * Store listing images for `:travel`. See `common-conventions-preview-metadata`.
 *
 * The four screens walk the booking: pick a fare, pick a seat, see the confirmed order,
 * and the hotel side of the app.
 *
 * Everything is a literal DTO. That matters more here than in the other apps, because every
 * one of these screens is normally filled by a live Duffel search:
 *
 *  - No logo or photo URLs. Layoutlib has no network, and both `AirlineLogo` and the stay
 *    card fall back cleanly to a badge / no image when the URL is blank.
 *  - No `expiresAt` on the offers. The price-hold banner counts down from `Clock.System.now()`,
 *    which would make the rendered PNG depend on when it was rendered.
 *  - Dates are fixed and in the future, so the images stay stable across re-renders.
 *
 * Each preview needs @PreviewTest as well as @Preview: @Preview alone renders in Studio but
 * is not collected as a screenshot test. Previews must also be class members, not top-level
 * functions. Order comes from the function names (Preview1…, Preview2…).
