/**
 * The UI contract between [GalleryViewModel] and the two screens the store listing is
 * captured from.
 *
 * Those screens take a state value plus an actions interface rather than the ViewModel
 * itself, so they can be rendered by a `@Preview` — see `src/screenshotTest`. It lives in
 * `util` rather than `ui` so the dependency runs one way: `ui` depends on `util`, and the
 * ViewModel implements the interface.
 *
 * Only the gallery and people grids are split this way. The rest of the app (the editor,
 * the map, the viewer) still takes the ViewModel directly — none of them can render
 * without a real image anyway.
