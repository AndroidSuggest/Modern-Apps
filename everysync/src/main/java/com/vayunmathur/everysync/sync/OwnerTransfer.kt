 * records signed by the *current* owner — the same outer encoding office uses on
 * its `owner:<docId>` channel (`OfficeViewModelSyncC.fetchOwnerKey`), so
 * cross-reader tolerance matches. Members follow the signed chain from the
 * vault's base owner key ([fetchOwnerKey]) to determine the current owner; a
 * transfer whose signature does not verify against the running key is skipped,
