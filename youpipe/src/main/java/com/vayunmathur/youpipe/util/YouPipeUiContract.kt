/**
 * The UI contract between [YouPipeViewModel] and the three screens the store listing is
 * rendered from: the home feed, the subscription feed, and the video page.
 *
 * Those screens take a state value plus an actions interface instead of the ViewModel, so a
 * `@Preview` can render them from literal data — no Room, no extractor, no network. It lives
 * in `util` next to the ViewModel so `ui` depends on `util` and not the other way round.
 * (The stream and comment types below are still declared in `ui`; the ViewModel already
 * imports them from there, and moving them would be a much bigger change than this one.)
 *
 * Anything the UI would otherwise derive from a Context or from the current clock — "1.2M
 * views", "3 days ago" — is pre-formatted into a plain string by the binder. That is what
 * makes a rendered preview byte-identical from one day to the next; a relative timestamp
 * computed at render time would churn the listing images every morning.
