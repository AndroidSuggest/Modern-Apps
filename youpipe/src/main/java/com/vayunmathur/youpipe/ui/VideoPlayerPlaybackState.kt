/**
 * Playback-owned state for [VideoPlayer]: audio/language selection, the media controller
 * lifecycle, transport observers, history writes, the media item, subtitles and tempo.
 *
 * Moved from VideoPlayer.kt (FileLength split); behavior identical. The view-owned half
 * (menus, lock, hover, PiP, aspect ratio, cast session, controls timer) lives in
 * [VideoPlayerViewState]; the player UI reads both via `with(pb) { with(vs) { ... } }`.
 * The controller/transport/history/media effects live in VideoPlayerPlaybackEffects.kt.
