//! Lenient fallback tokenizer for PDF content streams (§7.2, §7.3, §8.9.7).
//!
//! `lopdf`'s content parser wraps inline-image parsing in nom's `cut(...)`
//! (parser/mod.rs:555), so a failure inside it becomes a `Failure` rather than an
//! `Error`. `many0` propagates a `Failure`, which means ONE malformed or merely
//! unsupported inline image makes the ENTIRE content stream fail to decode and the
//! page render completely blank. lopdf hard-errors on:
//!
//! * any inline image with `/F` or `/Filter` (`Error::Unimplemented`),
//! * `/CS /G` — the §8.9.7 Table 93 abbreviation for `DeviceGray`, which is absent
//!   from lopdf's accepted name list,
//! * a missing `/BPC` or `/CS`, which is every `/IM true` stencil, since a stencil
//!   mask has no colour space and an implicit depth of 1.
//!
//! So this module re-tokenizes the stream by hand, accepting everything above and
//! recovering from outright garbage instead of aborting. It is used ONLY when
//! lopdf's strict parse fails (or yields nothing), so it cannot regress a file that
//! already renders.
//!
//! # The `BI`/`ID`/`EI` hazard
//!
//! Per §8.9.7 the `ID` operator is followed by exactly ONE whitespace byte and then
//! RAW BINARY image data. Scanning forward for the next `EI` is therefore wrong: the
//! byte pair `EI` occurs in binary pixel data constantly, and accepting a false match
//! resynchronizes the tokenizer into the middle of an image, turning the rest of the
//! stream into garbage operators — strictly worse than the blank page being fixed.
//!
//! Instead the expected data length is COMPUTED from `/W`, `/H`, `/BPC` and `/CS`
//! (or taken from `/L` / `/Length`, which PDF 2.0 added for exactly this reason),
//! exactly that many bytes are skipped, and the terminating `EI` is then verified.
//! Scanning is a last resort, reached only when the length genuinely cannot be
//! computed (a filtered image with no `/L`), and even then a candidate must be
//! whitespace-delimited AND followed by something that actually looks like a content
//! stream before it is accepted.
