/// The font cache key requires the STORED font dictionary to still equal the one
/// the object id resolves to now (`fonts.rs`, `cached_font`). That kills the
/// address-reuse collision above, but `Dictionary` equality is SHALLOW: a font
/// dictionary carries indirect references (`/Widths`, `/FontDescriptor`,
/// `/ToUnicode`, `/DescendantFonts`), and comparing them compares object
/// NUMBERS, not the objects they resolve to.
///
/// So two documents can hold a byte-identical font dictionary at the same object
/// id whose referenced metrics differ completely. This fixture is that case,
/// reduced to its simplest form: both documents allocate objects in the same
/// order, so both have the font at the same id with a dictionary naming
/// `/Widths 1 0 R`; only the CONTENTS of object 1 differ (every glyph 500/1000
/// vs 900/1000). Nothing about the dictionaries distinguishes them.
///
/// Same precondition as the address-reuse case — it needs one scope spanning two
/// documents, which no current caller does — so this is latent too. It is here
/// because "a colliding object id from another document cannot be served" is
/// slightly stronger than what shallow dictionary equality actually buys, and
/// that gap should be written down rather than rediscovered.
///
/// IGNORED, and it FAILS when run, exactly as its predecessor did before the fix.
/// Verified 2026-08-29 against the `ObjectId` + stored-dictionary key: the
/// 900/1000 document was served the 500/1000 document's metrics, giving an
/// advance of 10.0 (= 500/1000 x 20pt) where 18.0 (= 900/1000 x 20pt) is correct,
/// and glyph origins at 10/20/30 instead of 10/28/46. Ignored because no caller
/// can reach it, NOT because the finding is doubtful. Routed to `residuals`.
///
/// A deep fix does not need a deep dictionary compare: including the resolved
/// generation of each indirect target would cost as much as the parse being
/// cached. Cheaper is to scope the cache to a document identity that cannot be
/// recycled — a monotonic id minted per `Document` load — which closes the class
/// rather than another instance of it.
