/// consumer applies the marker unconditionally, so an empty accumulation clips
/// to EMPTY. That is the right reading for a run that shows only whitespace — a
/// space has no contours, so it contributes no outline — and it is safe only
/// because this side does not send the marker for a run that showed nothing.
///
/// "Shown" is an ITERATION property and is measured with the same decoder the
/// show path uses. Two cheaper proxies are both wrong, and each was tried:
///
/// * `!bytes.is_empty()` is an OPERAND property. `FontInfo::for_each_code`'s
///   Identity-H/V branch consumes codes in PAIRS (`while i + 1 < bytes.len()`),
///   so a ONE-byte string in a two-byte font is non-empty and yields ZERO codes.
///   Latching there sent the marker over an empty accumulation and blanked every
///   mark to the matching `ClipPop`. Caught by `fix-text`, `hunt-missing` and
///   `differential`.
/// * "a prim was emitted" is discontinuous. In a ten-glyph `Tr 7` run over a
///   full-page gradient, one glyph resolving gives a one-letterform aperture and
///   leaks ~0.3% of the page; zero resolving sends no marker, no clip, and the
///   gradient covers 100% of it. The failure inverts on a single `/ToUnicode`
///   entry. `differential` measured the two outcomes at MAE 15.15 (blanked, all
///   surviving content intact) against 155.70 (unclipped, none of it intact).
///
/// So a run whose glyphs were all dropped still latches and clips to EMPTY. That
/// is deliberate: the true aperture is a handful of letterforms, so empty is a
/// SUBSET of it and the error is bounded by the text's own area, whereas not
/// clipping is a superset of everything and the error is the whole page.
///
/// An earlier version rested this on the soft-mask precedent — an unexpandable
/// mask paints unmasked, losing the EFFECT not the artwork. `hunt-missing`
/// showed the disanalogy that sinks it: a soft mask MODULATES content that has
/// its own geometry, so dropping it leaks only within that path, while a text
/// clip DEFINES the extent, so dropping it leaks without bound.
///
/// `shown_mode` is the mode BEFORE [`hidden_render_mode`] may have rewritten it:
/// an optional-content group that is off still contributes its clip (see that
