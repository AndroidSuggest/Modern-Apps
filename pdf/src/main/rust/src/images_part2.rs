/// `isFilterBitmap = true` unconditionally, so every image is bilinearly smoothed on
/// upscale. For a photograph that is what a reader wants and no viewer does otherwise.
/// For BILEVEL art it is destructive in exactly the way round 1 established for the
/// downscale path: smoothing a barcode, a QR code, a scanned fax page or a stencil turns
/// its two colours into a ramp of greys and its hard 0/255 alpha into a translucent
/// fringe, which is the difference between a scannable QR code and an unreadable one.
///
/// So: honour an explicit `/Interpolate true`; otherwise smooth contone images and never
/// smooth bilevel ones. That deviates from the literal default for contone images, and
/// deliberately — the deviation is invisible, whereas obeying it would make every
/// magnified photograph blocky.
///
/// `interp` should pass this onto the `Prim::Image` record and `viewer` should carry it
/// on the wire and use it to choose `isFilterBitmap`. It is a standalone predicate rather
/// than an `ImageData` field so it can land without breaking either of their files.
///
/// UNWIRED, deliberately, and NOT dead code — do not delete it looking for a caller. The
/// policy is complete and tested (`interpolation_is_refused_for_bilevel_art`), but
/// `Prim::Image` has no field for it, so nothing serializes it and the Kotlin parser's
/// pre-v11 default (smooth) applies to everything. `wire.rs` records the rest: the wire
/// version bump to 11 and the `u8 interpolate` byte must land in the SAME change, because
/// bumping without writing the byte makes the parser eat the first byte of the image's
/// `u32 len` and desync every primitive after it. That crosses wire.rs and the Kotlin
/// side, so it is not this file's to finish.
