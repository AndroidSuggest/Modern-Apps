    // embedded contours (draw.rs), so ink and aperture come from different
    // sources and disagree by up to about a third of their union. That is the
    // ceiling, not the typical case: pdfTypeface() matches the generic family
    // and the bold/italic style the wire carries, so the mismatch is a weight
    // or metric difference within the right family, and a correctly matched
    // weight lands below it. A wholly wrong family would be worse but needs
    // Rust's family detection to be wrong, which is a separate defect.
    // Both shapes were substitute-derived before C4, so they were wrong
    // together and this was invisible; it is newly VISIBLE, not newly wrong.

    // carrier constraint on ClipPush above.

    // CONTRACT: every Text at rm 4..7 MUST be followed by a TextClipApply.
    // `textClipPath` is reset ONLY in that arm, so a record that never gets a
    // marker leaves its outlines pending and folds them into the NEXT text
    // object's clip. Rust guarantees this by latching on the same condition it
    // emits the record under; a latch predicate that misses an emit path
    // (e.g. the whole-run no-font-metrics record, which bypasses for_each_code)
    // breaks it.
