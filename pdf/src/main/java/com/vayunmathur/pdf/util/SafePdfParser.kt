/**
 * Decodes the compact little-endian primitive buffer produced by the native
 * renderer ([PdfNative.renderPage]) into a [SafePdfPage].
 *
 * Wire format v11 (must stay in sync with `pdf/src/main/rust/src/wire.rs`):
 * ```
 * header: u32 MAGIC=0x50444657, u32 VERSION (11 is the newest understood; Rust emits 10),
 *         f32 pageWidth, f32 pageHeight, u32 primitiveCount
 *  Legacy v1 fallback: header is f32 W,H,u32 count (no magic)
 *  v2..v10 fallbacks: same layout with fewer trailing fields for older cached pages
 * per primitive: u8 tag, then payload
 *   1 Text:   f32 x, f32 y, f32 size, u32 argb, u16 len, [utf8 bytes], u8 hasStroke,
 *      u32 strokeArgb, f32 strokeWidth, u8 renderMode (v4), u8 blend (v5), f32 advance (v7),
 *      u8 fontFlags (v8 bold italic), f32 hScale (v8)
 *   2 Fill:   u32 argb, u8 evenOdd, u16 nContours, [u16 nPts, [f32 x,y]...]... (v6), u8 blend (v5)
 *   3 Stroke: u32 argb, f32 width, u8 nDash, [f32 dash]..., f32 phase, u8 cap, u8 join,
 *      f32 miter, u16 nPts, [f32 x, y]..., u8 blend (v5)
 *   4 Image:  6*f32 ctm, u32 w, u32 h, u8 format, f32 alpha (v9), u8 blend (v10),
 *      u8 interpolate (v11), u32 len, [bytes]
 *   5 ClipPush: u8 evenOdd, u16 nPts, [f32 x,y]..., u16 nPathOps, [...] (v4)
 *   6 ClipPop: empty
 *   7 GroupPush: u8 isolated, u8 knockout, f32 alpha, u8 blend
 *   8 GroupPop: empty
 *   9 TextClipApply: empty (v4)
 *   10 SoftMaskPush: u8 maskType (0 alpha, 1 lum) (v5)
 *   11 SoftMaskContent: empty (v5)
 *   12 SoftMaskPop: empty (v5)
 *   13 SoftMaskTransfer: 256 * u8 LUT over the mask value (v11) — the /TR of the immediately
 *      preceding SoftMaskPush. Handled regardless of the declared wire version, so Rust may
 *      start emitting it without a version bump and an older stream that never contains it is
 *      unaffected.
 *   14 ImageTiled: 6*f32 ctm, u32 w, u32 h, f32 xstep, f32 ystep, i32 i0, i32 j0, u32 nx,
 *      u32 ny, f32 alpha, u8 blend, u32 len, [RGBA8888 bytes] — one repeating cell for a
 *      tiling pattern. No format byte; the payload is always raw RGBA8888. Tag-gated, so an
 *      absent emitter is a no-op.
 * ```
 * Pure function -> unit-testable. v9 adds per-image alpha, v10 per-image blend mode, v11 the
 * per-image /Interpolate flag. Rust still declares v10 until it writes that byte, at which
 * point the two must be bumped together — see the note on WIRE_VERSION in wire.rs.
 *
 * Robustness contract: a single malformed or over-sized primitive must never discard the
 * page. [parse] returns whatever decoded cleanly, because the caller
 * ([SafePdfDocument.renderPage]) can only turn a thrown exception into a null page, which
 * the UI shows as an indefinite loading spinner.

     * Upper bound on primitives decoded from one page — a BACKSTOP against a corrupt count
     * field, not a truncation policy. Over the bound we clamp and render a partial page,
     * never throw, because a throw here discards the whole page.
     *
     * It must sit comfortably ABOVE Rust's own ceiling, which is what actually bounds the
     * stream. Rust enforces `MAX_PRIMITIVES = 300000` (graphics_state.rs:166) at every
     * content-emitting push — guards at ~57 sites across interpret.rs, draw.rs and
     * annotations.rs, plus a hard `prims.truncate` in draw.rs.
     *
     * DO NOT LOWER THIS TO MATCH 300000. The guards protect content-emitting pushes, but the
     * bracket BOOKKEEPING around them is emitted for structural correctness whether or not the
     * cap has been reached — dropping a `ClipPop` would leave its clip un-restored and blank
     * the rest of the page, so several of those pushes and pops are deliberately unguarded
     * (e.g. interpret.rs:247, :1145-1148, :1555). The emitted count can therefore exceed
     * 300000, and a clamp set to exactly 300000 would cut exactly that bookkeeping.
     *
     * The excess is NOT limited to closers. `exceeding_the_primitive_cap_keeps_the_bracket_
     * structure_intact` measures three shapes: overshoot 1 at one fill per tile, 2 at forty
     * fills per tile, and 6 for a form XObject crossing the cap mid-operator, where the excess
     * is ["ClipPop", "ClipPop", "ClipPush", "ClipPop", "ClipPop", "ClipPop"] — a `Do` still
     * pushes its mandatory `/BBox` clip (§8.10.2) and pops it again even though it emits no
     * content. So it is bracket bookkeeping, pushes included, not bracket closers.
     *
     * No tight upper bound on the overshoot has been established, and two attempts to derive
     * one from bracket depth were wrong. Do not replace this constant with a formula: it is a
     * backstop against a corrupt count field, so the correct posture is generous headroom
     * (~700k here) rather than a bound we would have to keep re-proving.
     *
     * NOTE: this clamp is not the tightest bound anywhere. `MAX_CONTENT_OPS`
     * (graphics_state.rs:250, applied at interpret.rs:274 as `ops.iter().take(..)`) was raised
     * from 200000 to 1000000 once it was established that `ops` is a fully-materialised Vec, so
     * `take` frees no memory and the constant was a time guard being used as a memory guard.
     * Rust's `MAX_PRIMITIVES = 300000` is now the binding producer bound. Covered executably by
     * `golden_tests::content_beyond_the_caps_truncates_to_a_valid_page`, which derives its
     * content size from whichever cap is smaller rather than hard-coding one.
