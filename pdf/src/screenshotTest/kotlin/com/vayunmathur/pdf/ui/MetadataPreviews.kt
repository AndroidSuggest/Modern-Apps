/**
 * Store listing images for `:pdf`. See `common-conventions-preview-metadata`.
 *
 * The reader itself ([SafePdfViewerScreen]) cannot be previewed: it opens a document
 * through the native `pdf_render` library, which Layoutlib cannot load, and its ~40 pieces
 * of edit state are welded to that handle. What it is built from can be previewed, so these
 * images use the pieces that were split out of it — [PdfOutlineDrawer] and
 * [SafePdfPageCanvas] — over the literal document above, plus the two screens that were
 * already free of the native handle.
 *
 * Each preview needs @PreviewTest as well as @Preview: @Preview alone renders in Studio but
 * is not collected as a screenshot test. Previews must also be class members, not top-level
 * functions. Order comes from the function names (Preview1…, Preview2…).
