/**
 * The app drawer, as an overlay over the home screen rather than a separate destination.
 *
 * That is the whole reason it is not a nav route: an app has to be draggable straight out of here
 * and onto the grid, and a drag cannot survive crossing two destinations. Drawn inside the home
 * screen's gesture-owning root, every icon here registers with the same
 * [com.vayunmathur.launcher.ui.components.LauncherDragController] as a workspace item does — with
 * a null `itemId`, which is what marks it as something to insert rather than move. Launcher3
 * places AllApps in its `DragLayer` for exactly the same reason.
 *
 * A [LazyVerticalGrid] here, unlike the home screen: the drawer really is a flowing list of
 * uniform 1x1 items, which is what a lazy grid is for. The row spans and absolute cell
 * coordinates that rule it out for the workspace simply do not arise.
 *
 * [gridState] is hoisted because the home screen's gesture owner needs it: a downward swipe closes
 * the drawer, but only from the top of this list — anywhere else that swipe is this list's own
 * scrolling. [draggable] is false while the drawer is only part-way up, so a long press cannot pick
 * an app out of a drawer that is barely on screen. [strip] is hoisted for the same reason and is the
 * more delicate of the two: see [FastScrollStrip].
