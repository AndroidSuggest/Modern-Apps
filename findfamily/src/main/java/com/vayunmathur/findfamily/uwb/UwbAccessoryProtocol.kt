 *
 * The byte format is specified in:
 *   - Apple's PDF "Implementing Spatial Interactions with Third-Party Devices"
 *     (developer.apple.com/nearby-interaction → "Specification")
 *   - FiRa MAC Technical Requirements (TLV-encoded MAC params)

 * requires both specs in hand and is a multi-day task. The scaffolding
 * around them (transport, envelope routing, controlee session setup via
 * `android.ranging.RangingManager`) is complete.
