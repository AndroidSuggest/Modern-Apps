/**
 * Reconnect backoff: full-jitter exponential delay between redials.
 *
 * Pure policy, no threads or clocks: the service loop calls [onFailure] when a session
 * ends abnormally and sleeps the returned delay, and [onSuccess] when a session
 * establishes (or ends cleanly) to reset the streak. Delay for consecutive failure `n`
 * is uniform in `[0, min(maxDelayMs, baseDelayMs * 2^n)]` — full jitter, so a fleet of
 * phones hammering one head unit spreads out instead of marching in lockstep.
 *
 * @param jitter draws the actual delay within `[0, bound)`. Defaults to `Math.random`;
 *   tests inject a fixed draw to assert exact caps.
