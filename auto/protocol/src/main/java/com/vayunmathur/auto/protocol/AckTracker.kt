/**
 * Unwraps the 0x8004 `MediaAck` frame counter.
 *
 * The wire `ack` field is a frame counter **mod 256**: it wraps back to 0 every
 * 256 frames, so a raw value below the previous one is a wrap, not a
 * regression. This folds each arrival into a monotonically non-decreasing
 * sequence the phone UI can track; stale arrivals (reordered or duplicated
 * acks) hold the line instead of moving it backwards.
 *
 * Pure state machine, no I/O: the Android side feeds it parsed ack values and
 * publishes the unwrapped sequence.
