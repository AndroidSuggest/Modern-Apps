/**
 * The sensor source channel: subscribes to the full 26-type set on the ch7
 * grant and folds the head unit's batches into a last-known snapshot.
 *
 * The channel id comes from discovery, not from [GalService]: the DHU 2.0
 * discovery advertises the sensor source on service 1 (verified by decoding
 * the 0x6 payload: `Sensor{1} Sensor{10} Sensor{13}`, exactly the
 * `default.ini [sensors]` trio), while gearhead's `rro` numbers it 7.
 * Gearhead binds by payload (`jlf.a(xpa)` reads the sensor config out of
 * the service entry), and so do we -- [ProjectionService.openNext] passes
 * the id of whichever entry carries `sensor_source`.
 *
 * Bring-up needs nothing beyond the generic open: the sensor channel opens
 * in the wire-order pass like every other service, and subscribes go out on
 * the grant -- sending on a channel the head unit has not opened earns a
 * bare MessageError (0xff). One channel at a time is enforced by the pump's
 * sequential open order; subscriptions batch behind a single flush the same
 * way.
 *
 * Route by channel id: 0x8004 is SensorError here but MediaAck on media
 * channels and ACTION on ch14, so only sensor-channel traffic belongs to
 * [SensorCodec]. The 0x04 CONTROL frame flag does NOT mean "control channel"
 * (HANDOFF.md section 9) and never enters this decision.
 *
 * Full live values (maps-dev): feed phone GPS / fused speed through
 * [postLiveEvents] -- see [SensorSnapshot.withEvents] -- and read [snapshot]
 * for the car UI. The channel only subscribes; the snapshot is the value.
