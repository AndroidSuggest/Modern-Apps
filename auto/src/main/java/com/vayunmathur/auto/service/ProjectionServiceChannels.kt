 * Opens the next not-yet-attempted advertised service, in the HU's wire order.
 *
 * Only one open is ever in flight: while `pendingChannels` is non-empty the
 * head unit still owes us an answer, so wait.
 *
 * Service 1 IS sent, first: gearhead opens channel 0 locally and never sends
 * a 0x7 for it, but DHU 2.0 rejects a first-0x7 for service 2 with an empty
 * 0xff and no 0x8 (Run 4) -- so the HU-side may expect the wire-order
 * sequence to start at 1. If the HU 0xffs/0x8-refuses service 1 as well, it
 * lands in refusedChannels like any other refusal and the bring-up moves on
 * to service 2; the experiment then distinguishes "first-open must be 1"
 * (0x8 arrives for 1) from "video refused regardless" (both refused).
