/**
 * Hangul (한글) assembly: turns the jamo the Korean layouts emit into syllable blocks.
 *
 * Korean is written in square blocks of two or three jamo, and which block a jamo belongs to
 * is only decided by what comes *next*: type ㄱ ㅏ ㄴ and you have 간, but type ㅏ after that
 * and the ㄴ was never a final at all — it was the initial of 나, leaving 가 behind. That
 * "stealing" rule is why a Korean keyboard cannot just emit characters, and it is what this
 * class exists to do.
 *
 * The state is the three slots of one block (initial / medial / final); everything before the
 * current block has already been committed. Compound vowels (ㅗ + ㅏ = ㅘ) and compound finals
 * (ㄹ + ㄱ = ㄺ) are assembled and, on backspace, taken apart again one jamo at a time — the
 * behaviour of every Korean IME, and the reason backspace is not simply "delete a character".
