/**
 * Ethiopic (Geʽez) syllable assembly, for Amharic and Tigrinya.
 *
 * The script has around 300 syllables, far too many to be keys, but they are perfectly
 * regular: every consonant occupies eight consecutive codepoints, one per vowel, in the same
 * order (ä u i a e ə o). So the keyboard offers the ~34 consonants in their ä-form plus the
 * seven forms of አ as vowel keys, and typing a consonant then a vowel walks that many
 * codepoints along the consonant's row — ከ then ኡ is ኩ.
 *
 * A vowel always re-vowels the syllable in front of it rather than being appended, so a wrong
 * vowel is corrected by pressing the right one instead of by deleting.
