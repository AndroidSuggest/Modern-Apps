/**
 * A local mirror of the text immediately before the cursor, and of whether anything is
 * selected.
 *
 * Asking the field for either means a synchronous round-trip into the target app's process.
 * An IME that does that on every keystroke — which reading it for auto-capitalisation and
 * the double-space period amounts to — stalls for as long as that app's main thread is busy,
 * which is why a keyboard can feel fine in one app and stutter in another. So the service
 * reports its own edits here instead and reads the answer locally; the field is only
 * consulted when the mirror genuinely cannot answer.
 *
 * Telling our own edits from everyone else's is what the cursor arithmetic is for: each edit
 * says where it leaves the cursor, and a reported selection anywhere else came from outside
 * (a tap elsewhere in the field, the app rewriting it) and discards the mirror. Predicting
 * wrong therefore costs one reread and never a wrong answer.
 *
 * The mirror holds *final* text only. Callers must not read it while a composition is open,
 * which none do: auto-capitalisation gives up while a word is composing, and the space key
 * settles the composition before it looks behind the cursor.
