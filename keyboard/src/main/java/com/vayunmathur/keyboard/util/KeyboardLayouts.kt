/**
 * The catalogue of layouts the user can enable in settings.
 *
 * The rule every entry keeps is that you can write the language with it: each layout carries
 * its script's whole alphabet across its rows, its shift layer and its long-press alternates.
 * Where a letter would not fit that is checked against Unicode rather than assumed.
 *
 * Where a standard national layout exists and is known, the rows reproduce it, so muscle memory
 * from a physical keyboard carries over. Where it is not — the scripts marked "alphabetical" —
 * the rows are the script's alphabet in order, split across a base and a shift layer: learnable,
 * complete, and honest about what it is. Those are the first ones to replace as speakers of
 * those languages report what the real fingering should be.
 *
 * Korean, Chinese, Japanese and Ethiopic are typed through the composition engines in
 * [com.vayunmathur.keyboard.ime.Composer]: for those the rows are only half the story, since
 * what a key produces depends on the keys around it.
