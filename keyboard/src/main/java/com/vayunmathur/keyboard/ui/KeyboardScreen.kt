/**
 * Root of the keyboard view: a suggestion strip (when enabled) above whichever page of keys
 * is active. All sizing is weight-based so it fills the width; key height scales with the
 * user's height-scale setting.
 *
 * The pieces below are split into their own composables along the lines of what changes
 * while typing: a keystroke produces new suggestions and usually flips shift, and reading
 * either of those here would redraw every key on the keyboard twice per keypress.
