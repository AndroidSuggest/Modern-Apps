/**
 * A recurring daily window stored as minutes past local midnight.
 *
 * Minutes-past-midnight (rather than a timestamp) survives timezone changes and DST the way a
 * user expects: "9pm" means 9pm wherever the device is. [startMinute] greater than [endMinute]
 * is the normal case, not an error - a window that crosses midnight.
 *
 * Bedtime, downtime and school time are three answers to one question - when may apps be used -
 * so they share this predicate while keeping separate rows (separate on/off, times and days).
