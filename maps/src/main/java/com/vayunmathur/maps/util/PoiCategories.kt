 * Shared metadata for the OSM POI `type` enum baked into the v5 `ma_pois`

 * stable type map defined in `scripts/maps/README.md` /
 * `scripts/maps/osm_ingest/src/tags.rs`
 * (0..49 categories, 255 = "other"); never renumber, only append.
 *
 * Kept in one place so the offline search ([PoiIndex], the result subtitle) and the
 * archive's own POI vocabulary ([typeOfKind]) agree on what a numeric type means.
 *
 * The map no longer renders from these numbers — the renderer draws POIs from the archive by
 * kind name, with its own sprite sheet and per-kind zoom gating. The pin colour, glyph and
 * per-category min-zoom that used to live here went with it; what is left is the vocabulary
 * the offline index still speaks.
