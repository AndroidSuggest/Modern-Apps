 * The 64-bit Morton (Z-order) key that `poi_index.bin` and `nodes.bin` are sorted by.
 *
 * This is a bit-for-bit cross-language contract with `latlng_to_spatial` in
 * `scripts/maps/osm_ingest/src/spatial.rs` (the writer) and `Graph::latlng_to_spatial` in
 * `maps/src/main/rust/src/graph.rs`. The device binary-searches files the Rust tools wrote, so
 * a one-bit disagreement does not fail — it silently returns the wrong records. `SpatialKeyTest`
 * pins this against vectors generated from the Rust implementation rather than from expectation.
 *
 * Keys are `u64` held in a `Long` for their bits only. Everything north of the equator has bit
 * 63 set, so a signed comparison sorts the whole northern hemisphere *below* the southern one:
 * every comparison has to go through [java.lang.Long.compareUnsigned].

 * belongs to either x or y, and a 1 there forces that coordinate to be larger — so the box's two
 * extreme corners bound every point inside it. The interval is a *superset*: it also contains
 * points outside the box, which is why callers still test the exact coordinates.

 * equator or the prime meridian flips a top-level bit and spans most of the key space, which is
 * Z-order's known discontinuity (pinned in `spatial.rs`'s
 * `morton_jumps_a_whole_quadrant_at_a_quadrant_boundary`). `poi_spatial.bin` replaces this with
