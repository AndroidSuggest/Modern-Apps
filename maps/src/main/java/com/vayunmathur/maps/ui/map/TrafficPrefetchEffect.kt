/**
 * Prefetch traffic for the visible 1° squares once the camera settles, so the
 * overlay has data independent of route search (today traffic is fetched only
 * during a route search). The native side dedups squares for the session, so
 * a re-pan over an already-fetched square is a cheap no-op and the fetched
 * data is kept. Keyed on the toggle so it stops when traffic is off.
 * `collectLatest { delay() }` is the repo's debounce idiom (see
 * GooglePoiMapViewModel): a newer camera position cancels the pending delay,
 * so the fetch only fires after the camera stops moving.
 *
 * Extracted from MapSurface so no ui file exceeds the [FileLength] limit.
