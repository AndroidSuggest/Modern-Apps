 * speeds — small at the zooms this draws at — so a plain re-push each tick is the whole animation,
 * with no per-frame predictor. The native `Vehicle` carries a bearing but no speed, so there is no
 * cheap on-device dead-reckoning to do, and the shared sprite path is geography-agnostic; if smooth
 * 60 fps tweening is wanted later it belongs in the renderer's overlay draw, keyed on the stable

 * [VEHICLE_MIN_ZOOM]).
 *
 * Drive [com.vayunmathur.library.map.VectorMap]'s `vehicles` with the return value: it is pushed on
 * its own cadence, apart from the app pins, so a vehicle recompute never churns the pins and the
 * moving sprites stay out of the pin tap-pick. The loop samples the camera's live bounds each tick,
 * so a pan or zoom re-targets the enumeration without restarting the effect. Gated on the lifecycle
 * with the same ON_START/ON_STOP observer the renderer uses, so a backgrounded or hidden map stops
 * recomputing and clears its vehicles rather than leaving a stale swarm behind.
 *
 * [servingTripIds] is the set of pack trip ids behind the selected stop's departures board
 * ([com.vayunmathur.maps.data.transit.Departure.tripVehicleId], bit-identical to
 * [OfflineRouter.Vehicle.id]); only vehicles in the set draw, so the map shows the selected
 * station's own lines instead of every trip in the bbox. While the board is still loading (or its
 * entries are online-only with no trip id) the set is empty and nothing draws.
