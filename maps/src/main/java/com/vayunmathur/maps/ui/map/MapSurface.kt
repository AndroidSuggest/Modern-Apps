/**
 * The map surface: the renderer, its overlay layers, and what a tap on it means.
 *
 * Renders with library:map's [VectorMap] (Vulkan basemap, phone-side only). The overlay
 * pins and route are plain Compose in [MapLayers], hit-tested in-memory - the renderer
 * has no vector-layer API for them. The user puck is the exception: it has no hit-testing,
 * so it moved into the renderer as a [UserPuck] and no longer drags behind a pan.
 * Tile-baked place labels resolve through the native pick
 * ([queryRenderedLabels][com.vayunmathur.library.map.Projection.queryRenderedLabels]).
 *
 * The transit toggle is the one layer the renderer draws itself, via [LayerOptions]; see
 * [pinFeatures] for what that means for hit-testing.
 *
 * [sheetState] is null on expanded widths, where the side panel reads the selection
 * directly and there is no sheet to raise — so every tap handler skips it then.
