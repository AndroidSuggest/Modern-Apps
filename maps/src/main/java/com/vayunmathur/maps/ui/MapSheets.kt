/**
 * The compact bottom sheets: search over place, both wrapping the shared map
 * box. Extracted from MapPage so no ui file exceeds the [FileLength] limit.
 *
 * The search sheet is the outer of the two, so it draws over the place pane
 * rather than fighting it for the bottom of the window. Its content lambda is
 * empty while search is closed, which the scaffold treats as "no sheet" and
 * does not place — so this wrapper costs nothing at all on the browse screen.
