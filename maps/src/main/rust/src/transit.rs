//! On-device transit index loader + RAPTOR journey planner (P11b / world pack).
//!
//! Consumes the compact `.transit` index produced by the host tool
//! `scripts/maps/gtfs_ingest` (P11a). The on-disk layout (format v6 "TRX2") is
//! documented at the top of that tool's `src/index.rs` and MUST stay in sync
//! with the section constants and record accessors here.
//!
//! v6 adds two sections (25-26): a fixed-stride trip table and its CSR directory,
//! so a route's trips are addressable by index instead of only decodable from the
//! route's first trip. See [`Trips`] for what that buys and what it does not.
//! Packs without them fall back to the varint stream, unchanged.
//!
//! v5 adds two sections (23-24) holding a per-feed Transitous id prefix and each
//! stop's raw GTFS `stop_id`, which compose into a MOTIS stop id
//! (`us-ca-SF-bayarea_901201`). That is what lets the realtime `/stoptimes`
//! overlay name a stop without the `/map/stops` coordinate lookup. v3 and v4
//! packs are still accepted and simply report no MOTIS ids.
//!
//! v4 adds three sections (20-22) carrying GTFS `shapes.txt` geometry, so a ride
//! leg draws the vehicle's real path instead of a line through its stops. v3
//! packs are still accepted and fall back to stop-to-stop geometry.
//!
//! v2 exists to make a single global (world) pack feasible. Instead of an 8 B
//! `(arr,dep)` stop-time per stop *per trip* (which blew a world pack past the
//! u32 stop-time ceiling and ~10–20 GB), a trip is just `{ start_time,
//! profile_id }`, where a **profile** is the varint-delta run-time *shape*
//! (per-stop hop + dwell), deduplicated across every trip with that shape. Trips
//! are varint-packed per route; a **spatial grid** (sparse CSR) makes
//! nearest-stop / access / egress cell-local instead of O(all stops); and a
//! **FEEDS** table + per-route `feed_idx` let many agencies merge into one pack.
//!
//! The planner is transfer-aware RAPTOR (round-based, earliest-arrival). Each
//! round only processes freshly-marked stops (a marked-stop queue) rather than
//! scanning all stops, and access/egress use the grid — both required so a
//! world-sized stop set stays fast. Access/egress walk straight-line to nearby
//! stops rather than the road graph, keeping transit decoupled from the
//! road-graph merge gap; `lib.rs` re-draws the resulting walk legs along the
//! road graph afterwards, without re-timing them.
