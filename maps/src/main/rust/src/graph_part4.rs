// `.mamaps` file after the tile data, at 8-byte aligned offsets named by the
// section directory. This loader maps that one file once and hands
// [`Graph::assemble`] the same slices the multi-file [`Graph::load`] hands
// it, so every length check, index-total tie and sentinel bound runs
// identically on both layouts: the archive's own [`ArchiveView::parse`]
// refuses a corrupt container first, then the section payloads get exactly
// the validation the separate files always had.
//
// What backs the pointers (six per-file regions vs one archive region) is
// [`GraphOwnership`]; the `Graph` keeps whichever alive. The borrowed
// pointers are raw, so no lifetime ties the slices to the returned graph —
// ownership does that job instead.
