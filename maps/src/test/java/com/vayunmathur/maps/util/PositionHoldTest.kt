/**
 * The stationary-jitter gate behind the user puck's position.
 *
 * A phone on a desk still wanders a few metres per GPS fix; before this
 * existed every such fix moved the puck, so it jumped at 1 Hz while standing
 * still. A hold accumulates in-circle fixes into a running average and only
 * releases when a fix proves real movement — by speed, by leaving the gate
 * circle, or by outlasting the stationary timeout.
 *
 * The cases worth pinning are the escape hatches, because a gate with no way
 * out freezes the puck on a real departure.
