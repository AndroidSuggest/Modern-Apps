/**
 * Thin handle wrapper over the native `office_engine` document-tree CRDT.
 *
 * The CRDT algorithm (hierarchical tree over flat-ODF XML, RGA text merge, LWW
 * attributes) lives in the Rust crate; this class only owns a native handle and
 * forwards calls. The native serialization is byte-identical to the previous
 * Kotlin serializer, so the signed collaboration wire format is unchanged.
 *
 * Call [close] to release the native handle when the CRDT is no longer needed.
