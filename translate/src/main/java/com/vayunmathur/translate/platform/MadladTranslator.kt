/**
 * [TranslationEngine] backed by [MadladHandle] — MADLAD400-3B-MT on `:library:ml`'s
 * Vulkan runtime.
 *
 * The model is loaded lazily from [MadladModel.modelDir] the first time it is needed, and only
 * if the two files have been downloaded; until then [isAvailable] is false and the UI shows
 * a download prompt. Language detection is unnecessary — the UI's source picker names the
 * source — so [detectLanguage] returns null.
 *
 * MADLAD needs only the TARGET language: its tag (`<2en>`) leads the encoder source and
 * the decoder starts unforced from `<unk>`. The source language selects nothing — the
 * encoder reads whatever script arrives — so a null [from] (the UI's Auto sentinel)
 * needs no fallback: the tag is built from [to] alone. An unknown target tag fails
 * closed (null) rather than mistranslating.
 *
 * # The lock is not only for the handle
 *
 * A translation re-records the network once per decoded token, so two concurrent calls
 * would interleave recordings of the same command buffer. The mutex therefore covers the
 * whole of [translate] rather than just the load, and [close] too.
