//! What gets indexed, and how it is pulled out of a `.osm.pbf`.
//!
//! The database this replaces held **only** objects carrying both `addr:housenumber` and
//! `addr:street`. That left three large gaps, all of which show up as a geocoder that says
//! nothing useful:
//!
//! - **No streets.** Reverse geocoding could return a nearby house number or nothing at all;
//!   it could never say "you are on Foo Street".
//! - **No POIs or places.** A named building, shop or neighbourhood was invisible in both
//!   directions.
//! - **`addr:place` addresses dropped.** Many countries — much of Germany and Austria, and
//!   most of Japan and Korea — address buildings against a *place* rather than a street.
//!   Requiring `addr:street` silently discarded all of them.
//!
//! ## Pass ordering
//!
//! A PBF stores nodes before the ways that reference them and ways before the relations, so
//! anything needing way or relation geometry has to be read backwards, in three passes:
//! relations decide which ways matter, ways decide which node coordinates matter, and nodes
//! supply them. `osm_ingest::extract` documents this; the same ordering is reproduced here
//! because this crate drives the scan itself rather than emitting a layer.
