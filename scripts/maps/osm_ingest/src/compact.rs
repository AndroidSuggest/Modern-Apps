//! Degree-2 chain collapsing: the step that turns one graph edge per OSM
//! geometry vertex into one graph edge per road between junctions.
//!
//! Before this stage, `graph_build` emitted an edge for every consecutive pair
//! of way nodes, so every geometry vertex was a routing node with two
//! neighbours. California came out at 35.8 M nodes / 74.3 M directed edges — a
//! ratio of 2.07, the signature of a graph where almost every node is a
//! pass-through. Those nodes cost 16 bytes each in `nodes.bin`, 14 bytes per
//! direction in `edges.bin` and 8 bytes per direction in `lanes.bin`, and they
//! buy nothing: no route ever chooses anything at them.
//!
//! Collapsing them moves the vertices into `intermediate.bin` at 4 bytes each
//! (see [`crate::geom`]) and leaves the road network's shape untouched.
//!
//! # What may be collapsed
//!
//! A node is interior to a chain only when removing it cannot change a routing
//! decision or lose data:
//!
//! * exactly two incident segments, leading to two *distinct* neighbours that
//!   are both distinct from the node itself;
//! * both segments agree on road type, speed limit, name and one-way-ness, so
//!   the merged edge can carry a single set of attributes;
//! * their lane masks agree *in each traversed direction* — checked on mask
//!   contents, not on pool offsets, since two ways with identical lanes intern
//!   them at different offsets;
//! * one-way segments must actually flow through the node, one in and one out;
//! * the node carries no transit stop code, because `graph_build`'s isolated
//!   stop reconnection addresses stop nodes directly.
//!
//! # Chains that close on themselves
//!
//! A ring road whose every node is interior has no anchor to start from. The
//! lowest-numbered node on such a cycle is promoted back to a real node so the
//! ring becomes one edge from it to itself. A self-loop is inert for routing —
//! no shortest path traverses one — but it keeps the ring snappable and drawable,
//! which is all its interior nodes were doing anyway.
