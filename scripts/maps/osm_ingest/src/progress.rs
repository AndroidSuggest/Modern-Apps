//! A small stderr progress meter for the build's single-threaded scans.
//!
//! The parallel PBF passes already print a percentage of their own through
//! [`crate::pbf::run_pass_sink`]. This covers the sequential loops *between*
//! those passes — the kept-node scan, the rank index, the Morton sort setup, the
//! two CSR scans, the component walk and each write round — which used to run for
//! minutes at planet scale with nothing on screen.
//!
//! It writes to stderr rather than stdout so the meter's carriage returns never
//! interleave with the summary lines the build prints to stdout, and so a run
//! whose stdout is captured to a file still shows live progress on a terminal.
