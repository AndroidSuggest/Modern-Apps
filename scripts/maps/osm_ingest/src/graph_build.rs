//! Road-graph build: `.osm.pbf` -> `metadata.bin` / `nodes.bin` / `edges.bin` /
//! `lanes.bin` / `intermediate.bin` / `road_names.bin` (+ optional `elevation.bin`).
//!
//! A port of the former `scripts/maps/generator.cpp`, preserving the on-disk
//! contract byte for byte. The reader is `maps/src/main/rust/src/graph.rs`, which
//! is the authority for every layout decision here:
//!
//! | File | Layout |
//! |---|---|
//! | `metadata.bin` | `u32 magic "MARG"`, `u32 version`, `u64 node_count`, `u64 edge_count`, `u64 escape_count`, `u64 named_edges` (40 B) |
//! | `nodes.bin` | `NodeRec[node_count + 1]`, **12 bytes each**: `i32 lat_e7, i32 lon_e7, u32 edge_ptr`; the trailing sentinel's `edge_ptr` is `edge_count` |
//! | `edges.bin` | `EdgeRec[edge_count]`, **7 bytes each**: `i16 target_delta, u24 dist_mm, u8 type, u8 speed_limit`; then padding, `u32 escape_first[E.div_ceil(1024) + 1]`, `(u32 edge_idx, u32 target, u32 dist_mm) x escape_count`, padding, and the sparse name table — a presence bitmap with a rank index plus `u32 name_off[named_edges]`. See [`EdgeFile`] |
//! | `lanes.bin` | `u32 n`, then `(u32 edge_idx, u32 blob_byte_off) x (n + 1)` ascending by `edge_idx`, then the packed `u16` mask blob — **sparse**, only lane-bearing edges appear |
//! | `intermediate.bin` | the delta-encoded polyline blob ([`crate::geom`]) at offset 0, then a trailer: `u64 rank[..]`, `u8 present[..]` (one bit per directed edge), `u64 coarse[..]`, `u16 within[..]` over the *geometry* edges, and `u64 G`. See [`GeomFile`] |
//! | `road_names.bin` | deduped NUL-terminated string pool |
//! | `elevation.bin` | **optional** `i16[node_count]` of per-node ground elevation in metres (WS-G), written only with `--dem`; a build without it is still valid and the device reads every node's elevation as 0 |
//!
//! Every file's length is now an exact function of `metadata.bin`'s counts, and
//! the reader checks each one. `road_names.bin` is the exception: it is a byte pool
//! with no count of its own, and reads into it are bounds-checked instead.
//!
//! Three behavioural notes where this differs from the C++:
//!
//! * It is **deterministic**. The C++ filled its node array via
//!   `idx.fetch_add(1)` from concurrent workers and interned names in
//!   thread-scheduling order, so its node order, `name_offset` values and
//!   therefore all of `road_names.bin`/`edges.bin`/`nodes.bin` differed between
//!   two runs of itself. Here every parallel stage merges per-chunk results in
//!   chunk order, so the output is a pure function of the input.
//! * The C++ kept two bitsets, `useful_nodes_mask` and `road_nodes_mask`, but
//!   set and cleared them in exactly the same places, so they always held
//!   identical contents. One bitset does the same job for half the memory.
//! * **Degree-2 chains are collapsed** ([`crate::compact`]) and the geometry they
//!   carried moves into `intermediate.bin`. Pass 3 therefore builds *undirected*
//!   segments and defers the split into directed edges until after compaction,
//!   because pairing a `u -> v` edge with its `v -> u` twin — which
//!   `REVERSE_GEOMETRY_FLAG` depends on — is only unambiguous while the two are
//!   still one object.
//!
//! # Passes, and why there are four
//!
//! 1. **Refs + stops** (nodes and ways): mark the node bitset. Nothing about a
//!    way is retained.
//! 2. **Rank index**: `popcount` below an id becomes that node's address, so the
//!    node array is implicitly ordered by OSM id. That deletes the sorted
//!    `(osm_id, local_id)` table the edge pass used to binary-search, the
//!    per-node `osm_id`, and the per-node spatial key.
//! 3. **Node scan**: scatter coordinates into their dense slots and record which
//!    slots a blob actually filled.
//! 4. **Ways** (way blobs only): re-read them and emit segments directly.
//!
//! The order is not the obvious one. Pass 1 marks *every* ref of every routable
//! way, including refs to nodes no blob in the file defines — an extract clipped
//! at a boundary is full of them. Under dense addressing those refs own slots, so
//! coordinates must be scattered, and their arrival recorded, *before* anything
//! reads the node array; otherwise a dangling ref reads as `(0, 0)`.
