//! Gapless phase/subphase wall-clock timer for the maps pipeline.
//!
//! One `PhaseTimer` covers one tool run (which is one pipeline phase). Time is
//! booked by *switching*: `switch("next")` stops the current subphase and starts
//! the next one on the same instant, so subphases tile the phase wall with no
//! gaps and no overlaps — the stop of every subphase is the start of the next.
//! The summed subphases therefore equal the phase wall up to the microseconds
//! the switch itself costs.
//!
//! The timer starts in an implicit `"other"` subphase, which also absorbs any
//! stretch the caller never names. Callers name each major loop/pass and never
//! need to account for setup/teardown explicitly: whatever is left in `"other"`
//! at [`PhaseTimer::finish`] is the honest overhead bucket, not a fudge factor.
//!
//! Results leave the process as one parse-safe machine line on **stdout only**:
//!
//! ```text
//! TIMING {"phase":"tiles","wall_s":123.456,"subphases":[{"name":"stage-a","s":12.345}]}
//! ```
//!
//! Live progress meters stay on stderr (see `progress.rs`), warnings are
//! `WARN: ...` on stderr, errors `ERROR: ...` on stderr. Nothing else on stdout
//! may start with `TIMING `, and `TIMING` lines never go to stderr, so the
//! orchestrator can split the streams without ambiguity.
//!
//! Contract, kept identical in every crate that carries a copy of this file
//! (copies, not a shared crate: `gtfs_ingest` builds with zero dependencies,
//! and `par.rs` / `progress.rs` already follow the same copy convention):
//!
//! * std only, no dependencies.
//! * One timer per process, driven from the orchestrating (main) thread only.
//!   Worker threads never touch it; coarse loop/pass boundaries are the ticks.
//! * `finish` merges repeat visits to the same subphase name (e.g. per-zoom
//!   `map`/`merge`/`encode`/`append`) by summing, preserving first-seen order,
//!   so fine-grained loops stay bounded instead of exploding the output.
//! * Durations print with millisecond precision (`{:.3}` seconds).
//! * Never one entry per feed / per tile / per feature: group those loops into
//!   one bounded subphase (e.g. `parse-feeds`, `encode`), the way per-zoom work
//!   folds into four totals here.
