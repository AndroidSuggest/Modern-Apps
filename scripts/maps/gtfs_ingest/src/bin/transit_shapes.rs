//! `transit_shapes` — host build tool emitting the basemap's `transit` layer as
//! newline-delimited GeoJSON (geojsonseq), one `LineString` per distinct rail
//! polyline, carrying the agency's own `route_color`.
//!
//! Usage:
//!   transit_shapes <out.geojsonseq> <feed>...
//!   transit_shapes <out.geojsonseq> --manifest FILE
//!
//! `<feed>` is `feed_name=gtfs_dir[=motis_prefix]` or a bare `gtfs_dir`, exactly
//! as `gtfs_ingest` takes them, so the same `feeds.manifest`
//! `build_ca_transit.ps1` writes drives every tool in this crate.
//!
//! # Why GTFS rather than OSM route relations
//!
//! The layer used to be derived from `type=route` relations in the `.osm.pbf`,
//! which got both halves wrong. A relation's members include its **platforms**,
//! and the member role is not available where the colour is assigned, so every
//! platform way came out as a wide coloured band beside the track. And the colour
//! itself was the relation's `colour=` tag when it had one and a per-mode guess
//! when it did not. `routes.txt` carries the agency's official `route_color` and
//! `shapes.txt` carries the vehicle's real path with no platforms in it at all.
//!
//! # Why not read the `.transit` pack
//!
//! `reader.rs` already decodes a built pack host-side, but the pack's geometry is
//! fitted to a stop pattern, simplified at `shapes::SIMPLIFY_TOLERANCE_M` and
//! trimmed to `[first stop, last stop]`. That is right for drawing a journey leg
//! and wrong for a basemap line, which wants the untrimmed, unsimplified
//! alignment. So this reads the raw feeds.
//!
//! Like the rest of the crate: no serde, the JSON lines are hand-written.
