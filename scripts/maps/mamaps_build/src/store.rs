//! The feature store: classified features on **disk** rather than in memory.
//!
//! # Why this exists
//!
//! Measured on `california-latest.osm.pbf`, the generator peaked at 10.03 GB — so essentially
//! none of it was the tiler. It was all stage A, where three
//! large things were alive at once:
//!
//! | | California |
//! |---|---|
//! | materialised features, lon/lat `f64` | ~4.9 GB |
//! | classified ways and their node refs | ~2.7 GB |
//! | node id -> location table | ~2.5 GB |
//!
//! The features were the largest and the only one that did not have to be resident: nothing reads
//! them until the tiler does, and the tiler reads them **once per zoom, in order**. So they go to a
//! file, and the tiler streams it fifteen times instead of holding it fifteen times over.
//!
//! # The format is `tile_build`'s, not a new one
//!
//! [`spill::NormalizedWriter`] already writes exactly this: a length-prefixed record per feature
//! holding a lon/lat geometry and a property list. Reusing it means the encoding is already tested,
//! already round-tripped, and already handles every geometry kind — and it costs one small
//! indirection: the [`Class`] is packed into a single integer property. That is the plan's own
//! suggestion, and it is why this module needed no format of its own.
//!
//! The one change since made to that format was made *there*, for both its consumers: the geometry
//! is stored as `i32` e7 rather than `f64` degrees, halving the spill. Every coordinate `osm_ingest`
//! produces is already an e7 integer, so this archive is byte-identical across that change; see
//! [`spill::encode_geometry`].
//!
//! # The second table: classified ways
//!
//! [`WaySink`] and [`WayReader`] do the same for the ~2.7 GB row of that table, for the same reason
//! and by a different route: a way's record is a handful of integers rather than a geometry, and it
//! is read back in the order it was written, so it gets a format of its own rather than
//! `NormalizedWriter`'s. See [`WaySink`] for why no sort is needed on the way back.
