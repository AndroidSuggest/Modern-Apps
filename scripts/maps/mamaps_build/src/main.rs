//! `mamaps_build` — one `.osm.pbf` in, one `.mamaps` archive out.
//!
//! The generator this project exists to build. It produces all 9 layers (`landtype`, `roads`,
//! `boundaries`, `buildings`, `places`, `poi`, `transit`, `traffic`, `junction`), and the shape
//! does not change when a rule does because every layer is one module under [`schema`].
//!
//! ```text
//! mamaps_build --input california.osm.pbf --out california.mamaps
//!              --coastline LAND.shp --graph GRAPH_DIR
//!              --transit-routes ROUTES.geojsonseq --dem HEIGHTMAPS.mdem
//!              [--region california|world]
//!              [--build-graph-to DIR] [--build-poi-to DIR]
//!
//! All six flags are required. Every build carries all 9 layers at z0-14 as
//! FORMAT_VERSION 8: there is no layer selection, no zoom selection and no
//! store reuse, so a build is a pure function of its six inputs.
//!
//! `--region` filters the built layers (`roads`, `poi`, `buildings`) to the
//! region's bbox. Everything else is always included regardless. `world` (the
//! default) disables the filter.
//!
//! `--build-graph-to` / `--build-poi-to` fold the routing graph and POI
//! sidecars into this process instead of running `road_graph` / `poi_extract`
//! as separate binaries first. Same thread pool, one shared blob scan, and the
//! graph coverage is validated against the region before stage A runs — which
//! is what stops a 43-minute tile build dying on a missing `metadata.bin`.
//! ```
//!
//! # Why not through the existing tiler
//!
//! `tile_build` already turns GeoJSON-seq into PMTiles, and routing through it would have been less
//! new code. But it would also mean encoding to MVT and decoding again, which loses exactly the
//! attributes this format was built to carry: a road's `is_bridge`, a boundary's numeric admin
//! level, a ring's stated winding. So the geometry is reused — projection, significance,
//! simplification, tile bisection, clipping, all of `tile_build` — and only the last step, turning a
//! clipped shape into bytes, is this crate's.

/// The allocator, replaced because the default one was three quarters of the build.
///
/// A build tool has no business caring which allocator it gets, and this one did not until the
/// encode pass was measured against the machine it runs on: **1358 s of worker CPU against 180 s of
/// wall on a 32-core, 64-thread box** — a speed-up of 7.5 where the pool can give 64. Nothing in
/// that pass is shared. [`rings::normalise`], `body::serialize_into` and DEFLATE each read one tile
/// and write one tile, there is no lock and no atomic in the path with `MAPS_TIMING` off, and the
/// memory traffic works out at a few hundred MB/s against eight channels of DDR5. The only thing
/// all sixty-four threads still contend on is the heap.
///
/// And they hit it hard. `normalise` allocates a `Vec` per polygon group, another for its exterior
/// and one per hole it keeps, on the way to rebuilding a layer's arenas; z14 of a us-west build is
/// 44.4 M features across 943,401 tiles, which is tens of millions of allocate/free pairs on
/// Windows' process heap in about two and a half minutes.
///
/// Swapping it out took the tiling stage from **351 s to 110 s** on the same spill, for a
/// byte-identical archive:
///
/// | phase | default heap | mimalloc |
/// |---|---|---|
/// | map | 125.1 s | 72.9 s |
/// | merge | 33.2 s | 9.6 s |
/// | encode | 180.3 s | 21.6 s |
/// | append | 12.4 s | 3.3 s |
/// | *encode CPU: stage C* | *452.6 s* | *54.4 s* |
/// | *encode CPU: serialise* | *355.9 s* | *5.4 s* |
/// | *encode CPU: deflate* | *550.0 s* | *181.1 s* |
///
/// Serialisation is the one that says what this really was. It is a memcpy into a reused
/// [`tilecodec::mamaps::body::Scratch`] and it cost 356 s of CPU; it now costs 5.4 s. That was never
/// encoding, it was the handful of buffer growths per tile going to `HeapAlloc` under sixty-four
/// threads of contention.
///
/// Two things this is not. It is not a substitute for allocating less — `normalise` should be
/// threading scratch buffers through rather than building a `Vec` per ring, and a cheaper allocator
/// only makes that less urgent. And it is not free: mimalloc holds freed pages back rather than
/// returning them promptly, which took peak RSS from 6.86 GB to 10.14 GB on the same build. That
/// trade is worth revisiting if memory becomes the binding constraint again.
///
/// It cannot change a byte of the output — an allocator decides *where*, never *what* — so it needed
/// no argument about ordering, only a measurement. The us-west archive hashes the same either way.
