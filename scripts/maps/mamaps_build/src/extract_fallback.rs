//! Build-time containment fallback for place-label -> boundary links.
//!
//! Tapping a place label should outline its exact admin boundary. The authoritative half of that
//! link is membership: a boundary relation points at its own label node via an `admin_centre` or
//! `label` member, and stage A records that node -> relation pair into `region_links`
//! (`extract_part1.rs`). This module is the second half: for every place label that membership did
//! not link, pick the boundary that contains its centroid.
//!
//! # Matching order: members first, containment second
//!
//! The member map is never overwritten here. Fallback only inserts entries for place tagged-IDs
//! still missing from `region_links`, keyed the same way the tiler looks them up (the place's own
//! tagged node/way/relation id), so the two halves agree and `tiler_part5.rs` needs no change.
//!
//! # Where this runs
//!
//! Called from `main_part1.rs` between `extract()` returning and `tiler::Settings` construction,
//! with the finished [`Store`](crate::store::Store) and the member-built map. The store holds
//! whole lon/lat polygons (pre-tiler, pre-clip), which is the only place a containment test is
//! meaningful — at tiler encode time the geometry is tile-local clipped fragments. Two sequential
//! reads of the spill: one to collect boundary shapes, one to stream places and link them. No new
//! spills, no resident feature table.
//!
//! # Level bands
//!
//! A place kind only matches the admin levels it can actually name:
//!
//! | place kind | admin levels |
//! |---|---|
//! | `country` | 1–2 |
//! | `region` | 3–4 |
//! | `locality` | 7–12 |
//!
//! Levels 5–6 (county) intentionally match nothing. Those boundaries only link via relation
//! members; anything else masks nothing rather than the wrong county. `neighbourhood` and
//! `macrohood` places likewise match nothing — a suburb centroid inside a city boundary must not
//! outline the city.
//!
//! # `REGION_NONE` rules: when in doubt, mask nothing
//!
//! A missing link leaves the tiler's `REGION_NONE` path (mask nothing), so every uncertain case
//! emits nothing: zero in-band candidates, an ambiguous pick (two containers' areas within ~1% of
//! each other), or the place sitting on a ring edge (where ray-casting is a coin flip). Ambiguity
//! favors no-mask over wrong-mask.
//!
//! # Cost cap
//!
//! Boundaries are partitioned by band (a place only ever tests its own band) behind a coarse
//! 4-degree grid, with a bbox reject before any point-in-polygon test, in a single pass per read.
//! Per-place work is then a handful of candidates, not the whole boundary set. If profiling ever
//! shows this dominating, the documented escape hatch is a rank-based skip (only attempt fallback
//! for places above a population-rank floor) — not yet implemented, and the per-kind counts in
//! [`FallbackStats`] are the numbers that would size it.
