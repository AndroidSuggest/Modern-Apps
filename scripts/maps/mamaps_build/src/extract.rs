//! Stage A: `.osm.pbf` in, classified geometry in lon/lat out.
//!
//! Three passes, because a PBF is ordered nodes-then-ways-then-relations and a way's geometry needs
//! coordinates that arrived before its tags did:
//!
//! 1. **ways + relations.** Classify tags. Spill the node refs of every classified way to a
//!    sequential file and keep the member way ids of every classified relation. Node blobs are
//!    skipped outright.
//! 2. **ways again**, keeping the refs of the ways some relation lists as a member. A second pass
//!    rather than keeping every untagged way's refs from the first, because "every untagged way in
//!    California" is 40 M node ids and the members are a few hundred thousand.
//! 3. **nodes.** Fill coordinates for exactly the ids the first two passes asked for, at 16 bytes
//!    per needed node.
//!
//! That last point is the whole memory argument. [`osm_ingest::nodeloc::NodeLocations`] costs
//! `O(needed)`; `graph_build`'s bitset costs 2.5 GB keyed by raw OSM node id whatever the extract,
//! and peaks near 10 GB on California. A water-and-buildings build needs a few million nodes, so it
//! pays tens of megabytes.
//!
//! # Nothing large is resident across the passes
//!
//! Neither of the two big tables this stage produces is held in memory. Features go to
//! [`Store`]; classified ways go to [`WaySink`], exploiting the fact that pass 1 already sees them
//! in ascending id order so no sort is needed to read them back in the order the archive wants.
//! What stays resident is the set a sequential file cannot serve: the refs of the ways that some
//! relation lists as a member, because a relation reaches those by id in its own order.
//!
//! # Collecting the needed ids: two shapes, one switch
//!
//! Pass 3 needs the ids sorted and unique, and there are two ways to get there. The obvious one --
//! one `Vec<i64>` of every ref **with duplicates**, sorted and deduped in place -- is what
//! [`collect_needed_in_memory`] does, and it is right up to a point: it is exact, it needs no
//! assumption about the ids, and on anything smaller than a continent it is smaller than the
//! alternative. Past that point it is the largest thing in the whole build. North-america is ~19 GB
//! of it; planet projects to ~96 GB and a sort of 12 G elements.
//!
//! [`collect_needed_by_bitset`] is the other shape, taken above [`REFS_IN_MEMORY`]: a bit per node
//! id, which is at most ~1.7 GB *for any extract, forever*, because OSM's node ids are monotonic and
//! near 13 G. Walking it low to high yields sorted unique ids directly, so it removes the vector and
//! the sort together, in one streaming pass with no extra I/O. Both paths must produce the same
//! sequence and `the_two_ref_collectors_agree_on_the_same_input` holds them to it.
