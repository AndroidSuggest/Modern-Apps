//! Fill in the lane count of a junction stub from the road it interrupts.
//!
//! # The defect this exists for
//!
//! [`schema::roads::lane_count`](crate::schema::roads::lane_count) reads the OSM `lanes` tag and
//! nothing else, and a way that does not carry one gets zero — which the renderer turns into
//! `oneway ? 1 : 2`. That default is right for the untagged residential street it was written for.
//! It is wrong for the twenty metres of asphalt between the two carriageways of a divided
//! arterial, because a mapper who tagged `lanes=6` on the road either side very often left the
//! short piece in the middle untagged.
//!
//! The result reaches a screen as an intersection that is *narrower than the roads entering it*.
//! Measured at Broadway × Rollins Road in Burlingame, the case this was written for: Rollins is
//! 6.1 painted lanes west of the junction and 4.1 east of it, and **2.0 lanes through it** — the
//! narrowest pavement in the scene is the middle of the intersection. Way `417329335` is that
//! stub: nineteen metres, no `lanes`, no `lanes:forward`, no `lanes:backward`, sitting between
//! neighbours tagged 6 and 4.
//!
//! **This is not a defect in the extract.** [`crate::extract`] reads one OSM way to one feature
//! and never splits a way, so there is no `lanes` tag being dropped anywhere. The data genuinely
//! does not have one.
//!
//! # What this is, and what it is not
//!
//! **It is inference, and it must be read as inference.** Nothing here is tagged. What makes it
//! legitimate is not that the guess is good but that *the thing it replaces is also a guess* —
//! `oneway ? 1 : 2` is an invention with no more support in the data than this has, and it is a
//! worse one, because it ignores the two tagged measurements sitting at either end of the way it
//! is guessing about. Replacing a context-free invention with a context-sensitive one is the whole
//! of the claim. It is not a claim that the answer is right.
//!
//! Nothing here ever overrides a tag. A way that carries `lanes` keeps it.
//!
//! # What counts as the same road
//!
//! A way inherits only when **every** one of these holds. Each was measured against the whole San
//! Francisco peninsula extract — 27,287 drivable ways, of which 13,674 carry no `lanes` tag.
//!
//! * **It carries no `lanes` tag at all.** Never override data.
//! * **It has a name**, and the donor has the same one.
//! * **It is at most [`MAX_STUB_M`] long.**
//! * **A donor at *both* ends**, each collinear within [`MAX_TURN_DEGREES`] and agreeing on
//!   one-wayness.
//! * **The donor is itself tagged.** Not inherited — see "one hop" below.
//!
//! ## Why name *and* collinearity, rather than either
//!
//! | rule | candidates | of which the donor disagrees on one-wayness |
//! |---|---|---|
//! | same name only | 343 | 77 |
//! | collinear only | 393 | 77 |
//! | **both** | **290** | **40** |
//!
//! Neither alone is safe. Name alone joins a street to itself around a hard corner, which is a
//! different carriageway. Collinearity alone joins a street to whatever runs straight on through
//! the junction, and a road changing its name at a crossroads is ordinary. Requiring both is the
//! intersection of the two, and the last column is the evidence that it is the *right*
//! intersection rather than merely the smaller one: the disagreement rate on an independent
//! attribute nobody selected for — one-wayness — halves. Pairs that were never the same
//! carriageway are what that column counts, and requiring both conditions removes half of them.
//!
//! Matching on `ref` as well as `name` was measured and rejected: over the same extract it admits
//! exactly one further way, a 257 m motorway spur, which [`MAX_STUB_M`] excludes anyway.
//!
//! ## Why one-wayness has to agree
//!
//! `lanes` counts **both** directions. A two-way `lanes=6` inherited onto a one-way stub paints
//! six lanes running one way where the truth is about three, so the error is not a small
//! misjudgement but a doubling, in the direction that reads as a broken map. This is a
//! correctness condition and not a tuning knob; it costs 290 candidates down to 252.
//!
//! ## Why the minimum of the donors
//!
//! Over the same extract, at [`MAX_STUB_M`]: taking the minimum changes 113 ways by an average of
//! +1.33 lanes; taking the maximum changes 135 by +1.82. Both fix the reported defect. The
//! minimum is preferred because the two errors are not symmetric — too narrow reads as a cautious
//! map and too wide reads as a wrong one.
//!
//! Note the gap between 156 ways that qualify and 113 that change: where the minimum lands on the
//! value the default would have produced anyway, nothing is emitted. A rule that declines to speak
//! unless both of its neighbours jointly justify it is behaving correctly, not under-reaching.
//!
//! ## Why a length bound, and why in metres
//!
//! Candidate lengths run to a long tail — median 33.5 m but p90 202.7 m and a maximum of 804 m.
//! Unbounded, half a kilometre of El Camino Real quietly goes from the default 1 to 2, and 519 m
//! of San Bruno Avenue West from 1 to 3. That is no longer a junction stub; it is a road, and a
//! road acquiring a width from a neighbour it merely touches is the failure mode this bound
//! exists to prevent.
//!
//! [`MAX_STUB_M`] is 50 because of what is being modelled rather than where a percentile falls.
//! The subject is the pavement inside a junction, or the link between the two carriageways of a
//! divided road: [`schema::junction`](crate::schema::junction) already takes an intersection to be
//! about 14 m from its centre to its edge, so a box some 28 m across, and a divided-carriageway
//! link runs 15–30 m. Fifty clears that comfortably and sits well below the p75 of 99 m, so it
//! excludes the tail by construction. Relaxing 50 → 100 m buys 17 more changed ways; removing the
//! bound entirely buys 49 and admits the two above.
//!
//! **Metres, not node count.** A node count looks like a proxy for a short way and is not one: way
//! `23925587` in the same extract is a two-node way 497 m long.
//!
//! ## One hop, never a chain
//!
//! A donor must carry a real tag. An inherited count never becomes a donor, so a tagged way's
//! width can travel exactly one way and no further — a property of the rule's shape rather than a
//! limit someone has to remember to enforce. Chaining would also need iteration to a fixpoint
//! inside a pass whose output must be byte-identical at every thread count.
//!
//! # What is deliberately *not* touched
//!
//! Only the lane **count** — the width the carriageway is painted. Not
//! [`turn_masks`](crate::schema::roads::turn_masks) and not
//! [`carriageway`](crate::schema::roads::carriageway).
//!
//! A count is a physical property of the road that plainly continues across a junction. A turn
//! arrow and a directional split are surveys of a *particular* piece of asphalt, and they do not.
//! There is also a concrete trap: `osm_ingest::tags::build_dir_lanes` pads its mask list to the
//! lane count, so feeding an inferred count into the masks would grow the list and **draw turn
//! arrows that no one tagged**. Ways with `turn:lanes` and no `lanes` do exist — way `417976725`
//! on Rollins Road is one. Arrows stay strictly data-driven.
//!
//! # How it is computed
//!
//! A hash-partitioned external group-by, because the in-memory form does not survive contact with
//! a planet build. Every named road way contributes one record per endpoint; on the peninsula
//! extract that is tens of thousands, but scaled to a planet's ~70 M drivable ways it is of the
//! order of 4 GB against a build already peaking near 7 GB. Pre-filtering by node count was
//! measured and does not rescue it — it still holds ~1 GB while losing real candidates.
//!
//! So records go to [`PARTITIONS`] files, partitioned on the endpoint node id. Every way meeting
//! at a node lands in the same file, which is the only grouping the rule needs, and each file is
//! then sorted and grouped on its own. Peak memory is one partition rather than the whole planet.
//!
//! Recipients longer than [`MAX_STUB_M`] are dropped before they are ever written — an untagged
//! way is never a donor, so a long untagged way cannot affect anything and need not be stored.
//! That alone removes three quarters of the recipient records.
//!
//! Names are hashed to a `u64` rather than carried. A collision costs one wrong inheritance and
//! cannot cost more than that: the collinearity and one-wayness conditions still have to pass, and
//! the result is still bounded by [`MAX_STUB_M`] and by the minimum of the donors.
