//! Stage C: normalise ring winding and hole containment, once, at build time.
//!
//! # Why this is worth a module
//!
//! The published z0 ocean tile is one polygon with **105 holes**, of which 40 overlap each other, 6
//! straddle the exterior, 4 are entirely outside it and 13 are lakes nested inside other holes.
//! `tess::fill` on device repairs all of that every time the tile is tessellated, under a frame
//! budget, in `i32`. Doing it here instead costs nothing anyone waits for, runs in `f64`, and turns
//! a per-frame repair into a one-time fact — which is what
//! [`FLAG_RINGS_VALIDATED`](tilecodec::mamaps::header::FLAG_RINGS_VALIDATED) tells the renderer.
//!
//! # What "valid" means here
//!
//! Per part group, after this runs:
//!
//! 1. exactly one exterior, wound counter-clockwise;
//! 2. every hole wound clockwise;
//! 3. every hole strictly inside its exterior;
//! 4. no two holes overlapping;
//! 5. no zero-area ring.
//!
//! Those five are what `tess::fill` assumes and what the batch check in this module's tests asserts
//! over every tile of a real build.
//!
//! # What it does not do
//!
//! It does not clip a straddling hole to its exterior or subtract one overlapping hole from another.
//! Both need a real boolean operation, and getting one subtly wrong is worse than dropping the hole:
//! a dropped hole paints a lake as land, which is visible and wrong; a botched intersection paints a
//! wedge across a continent, which is visible and inexplicable. So a hole that cannot be placed
//! cleanly is **dropped and counted**, and the count is in the build report.
