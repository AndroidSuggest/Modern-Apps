//! `boundaries`: the one layer whose detail is a number.
//!
//! An administrative boundary's whole meaning is its **level** — 2 is a country, 4 a state, 6 a
//! county, 8 a city — and the style compares it with `<=` rather than matching a name: one layer for
//! country borders and another for everything below. So the level is carried as a plain integer in
//! the `kind_detail` field under [`FLAG_DETAIL_NUMERIC`], rather than interned. Interning it would
//! mean interning every integer, and comparing `<=` against an id that is not ordered like the value
//! would be worse than useless.
//!
//! A `kind` is carried too, for the differential harness and for a future style that wants a county
//! line dashed differently from a state line. It is derivable from the level, which is exactly why
//! the level is what the style reads.
//!
//! # A boundary is a line, and cannot be an area
//!
//! Carrying the region as an area was tried, so that tapping a city could dim everything outside
//! it, and it has to be reverted: **clipping a polygon to a tile adds segments along the tile
//! edge** to close the ring, and the style's boundary layers are `line`, which strokes a polygon's
//! outline. Those synthetic edges are then drawn, and the map is covered in a grid of tile borders.
//! Clipping a *line* merely truncates it, which is why the line form has never had this problem.
//!
//! There is no way to opt out from the style side either: the `boundaries` entry declares no
//! `kinds`, so it matches every feature in the layer and would stroke a polygon whatever kind it
//! carried.
//!
//! Whatever eventually feeds a region mask therefore needs somewhere the boundary style does not
//! reach — a kind the layer excludes, or a layer of its own — decided together with the mask
//! rather than guessed at here.
//!
//! # The marking convention rides on this layer too
//!
//! Which side traffic keeps and what colour separates the directions are properties of the
//! *country*, and the only country geometry this build has is the `admin_level=2` relations it
//! already streams for the border lines. [`Conventions`] turns those into a coarse grid the tiler
//! stamps onto each tile's body, so the renderer never has to carry a polygon set to answer a
//! question that never changes for a given tile.
