//! On-disk spill for the streaming tiler: a record format, and `tile_id`-range buckets.
//!
//! [`crate::pyramid::build_archive`] holds every feature and, per zoom, every CLIPPED
//! copy of every geometry: one per `(feature, tile)` pair, plus the `tile -> candidates`
//! map that indexes them. So it is proportional to the input bytes and then again to the
//! zoom's OUTPUT geometry, which is why a `roads` layer — every OSM road, z11-16,
//! planet-wide — cannot be built by it: the `maxspeed` layer, which is only the ways
//! carrying a `maxspeed` tag and one zoom shallower, already produces an 8.3 GB archive.
//!
//! Holding the clipped copies is what [`crate::subdivide`] costs that path. The old loop
//! clipped lazily inside the per-tile encode batch and could throw each copy away, but it
//! paid a full vertex walk per tile to do it — `O(T · V)` for a feature reaching `T`
//! tiles. Keeping the descent's output instead trades memory for that, and it is the
//! right trade *here* because this path is the in-memory oracle the byte-identity tests
//! pin the streaming one against; anything at real scale goes through
//! [`crate::pyramid::build_archive_to`], which spills these very records to disk.
//!
//! This module is the disk that replaces that memory. It follows
//! `osm_ingest::chains`: manual little-endian encode and decode, a zero-filled reserved
//! tail so a field can be added without moving anything, counts cross-checked against
//! file length, and `Drop` cleanup so a run that dies mid-planet cannot strand tens of
//! gigabytes.
//!
//! Two files, for two different jobs:
//!
//! * **The normalized file** ([`NormalizedWriter`]) is the geojsonseq parsed exactly
//!   once into a compact binary. Every zoom then re-reads that instead of re-parsing
//!   JSON, which is the cheaper end of a trade that has to be made six times. The same
//!   pass records a fixed-stride offset index ([`NormalizedSummary::chunks`]), so those
//!   re-reads can be spread across the pool via [`NormalizedChunks`] rather than pulled
//!   through one cursor.
//! * **The buckets** ([`BucketSet`]) hold one record per `(feature, tile)` pair for ONE
//!   zoom, partitioned by `tile_id` range.
//!
//! # Why buckets and not an external merge sort
//!
//! [`crate::pmtiles::StreamBuilder`] needs tiles in ascending `tile_id`. A bucket index
//! of `(tile_id - lo) / span` is monotonic in `tile_id` by construction, so consuming
//! buckets in ascending index, each one internally sorted, yields globally ascending
//! `tile_id` — which is exactly that precondition, for one write and one read of the
//! spill. `osm_ingest::graph_build`'s rescan-per-round model would instead re-read the
//! whole spill once per round, and because Hilbert ranges are spatially local they are
//! badly skewed: an ocean range is empty and a metro range is enormous, so the round
//! count would have to be sized for the worst range and the rescan becomes thousands of
//! full passes. There is no `BinaryHeap` here for the same reason there is none anywhere
//! else in `scripts/maps`.
//!
//! Skew is handled by re-partitioning an oversized bucket over its own id sub-range
//! rather than by hoping. Sub-buckets ascend within a parent and parents ascend, so the
//! append-only order holds at every depth.
//!
//! # Props are inlined
//!
//! A feature touching forty tiles writes its properties forty times. That costs spill
//! bytes and keeps every read sequential, which is the trade worth making first. The
//! alternative — properties once in the normalized file plus a fixed-stride index keyed
//! by `seq`, exactly the `chains.rs` `hdr`+`pts` shape — is what [`SpillRecord::seq`] is
//! for, and should only be built if a measured run approaches the disk ceiling.
