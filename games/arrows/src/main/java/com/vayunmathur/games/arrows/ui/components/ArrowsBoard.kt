/**
 * The board.
 *
 * Painted in one [drawBehind] pass rather than as a composable per cell: an arrow spans several cells
 * and has to be a single continuous stroke with one arrowhead, which per-cell composables cannot
 * express. Taps anywhere along an arrow are resolved by arithmetic on the touch position, which is
 * both simpler and more accurate than hit-testing a stack of overlapping boxes.
 *
 * Because a canvas carries no semantics, one transparent box per arrow is laid over its head cell to
 * give screen readers something to find and activate.
