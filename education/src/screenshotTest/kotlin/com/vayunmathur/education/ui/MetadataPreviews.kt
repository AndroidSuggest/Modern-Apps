/**
 * Store listing images for `:education`, rendered from Compose previews instead of from an
 * instrumented test on a device.
 *
 * `./gradlew :education:metadata` renders these and copies the PNGs into
 * `metadata_data/photos/education/`, where `release.sh` picks them up.
 *
 * Four things to keep in mind when editing:
 *
 *  - Order matters, and it comes from the function names. The generated PNG filenames embed
 *    the function name, so `Preview1Catalog`/`Preview2Course`/... sort into listing order.
 *    Renumber the functions if you reorder the listing.
 *  - Everything must be a literal. No content pack is loaded and no database exists here, so
 *    the state below is the whole input — which is also what makes the output reproducible
 *    from a clean checkout. Deadlines are deliberately left out: their chip is worded
 *    relative to today ("Due in 3 days"), which would make the image depend on the clock.
 *  - Each preview needs @PreviewTest as well as @Preview. @Preview alone renders in Studio
 *    but is not collected as a screenshot test, and the build fails with the unhelpful "did
 *    not discover any tests".
 *  - The previews must be members of a class, not top-level functions. Top-level previews
 *    land in a synthetic `…Kt` facade that the screenshot engine silently skips.
 *
 * Rendering goes through the app's real [DynamicTheme] with `darkTheme = true`, matching the
 * `cmd uimode night yes` the old on-device generator used. Material You sources its palette
 * from the device wallpaper, which does not exist here, so these render with the fallback
 * scheme rather than a user's actual accent colour.
