/**
 * Ingredient lookup for the recipe builder.
 *
 * Both functions used to be HTTP calls to `/api/food/search` and
 * `/api/food/data/:id`. They now read the [FoodDatabase] bundle on the device,
 * so the recipe flow makes no network requests at all — the only time the app
 * touches the network for food is when the user explicitly downloads or
 * refreshes that bundle.
 *
 * The server endpoints are still live for older builds. Nothing here calls
 * them, and there is no network fallback: if the bundle isn't installed these
 * return nothing, and the search UI shows only locally saved ingredients.
