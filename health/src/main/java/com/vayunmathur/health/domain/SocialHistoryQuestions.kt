/**
 * The social history questions the app asks, with the codes FHIR wants for each answer.
 *
 * Every code here was taken from the LOINC 2.83 release rather than recalled: the question codes
 * from `Loinc.csv` and the LA answer codes from the release's own `AnswerList.csv`, using the answer
 * list LOINC marks NORMATIVE for that question. Getting a concept id wrong in a medical record is
 * not a cosmetic bug, so none of these should be edited without checking them against the release
 * the same way — `analysis/loinc_answers.py` does exactly that.
 *
 * Deliberately a data table rather than more columns on the profile. C-CDA's Social History
 * Observation covers occupation, industry, lifestyle and environmental risk factors, so this list
 * will grow; a table grows by one entry, whereas the fixed-column shape would have needed three
 * more columns and a migration each time.
 *
 * Smoking and pregnancy are *not* here. Both have their own US Core profiles bound to SNOMED rather
 * than to a LOINC answer list, so they stay as their own fields — see `HealthProfile`.
